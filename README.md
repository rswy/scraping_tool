# Web Scraping: Amazon Electronics Best-Sellers

This project contains a suite of Python scripts designed to scrape, process, and analyze data from Amazon's "Best-Sellers in Electronics" page. It demonstrates a robust, two-stage scraping process and provides insightful data analysis.

## Project Structure

- `requirements.txt`: A list of all necessary Python packages for the project.
- `config.py`: A centralized configuration file for all settings, URLs, and CSS selectors.
- `scrape.py`: The core web scraping script that handles browser automation and data extraction.
- `analyze.py`: Script to analyze the json data scraped from the Amazon website.
- `amazon_bestsellers_enriched.json`: The output data file generated by the scraper.


## Instructions for Execution

### Step 1: Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Python 3.8** or newer installed.
- Ensure you have **pip** (Python's package installer) available.

### Step 2: Setup Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv scraping_env
    ```

2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\scraping_env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source scraping_env/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Web Scraper

The script will launch a headless Chrome browser, navigate to Amazon, scrape the data, and save it to a JSON file.

-   Execute the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python scrape.py
    ```
    -   The process will take several minutes to complete as it includes deliberate, randomized delays to avoid being blocked.
    -   Upon completion, a file named `amazon_bestsellers_enriched.json` will be created in the project directory.

-  (OPTIONAL) Execute the following command in your terminal: 
    ```bash
    python analyze.py
    ```
    -   The process will go through the `amazon_bestsellers_enriched.json` file and output an analysis summary. Charts will be stored in the data_analysis folder within the root directory.
