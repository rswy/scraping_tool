            "I bought an Apple AirTag originally to keep track of my keys and wallet, but the real game-changer was using it for my cats' collars ‚Äî and it‚Äôs been amazing!\n\nThe setup was seamless (as you'd expect from Apple). Just a quick tap with my iPhone, and the AirTag was ready to go. I love how precise the location tracking is ‚Äî especially with the Find My app. I can literally walk around and be guided right to whatever (or whoever) I‚Äôm trying to find.\n\nAs a pet owner, the peace of mind this little device gives me is priceless. One of my cats likes to sneak out into the yard and hide in bushes ‚Äî now I just ping the AirTag and follow the sound or use Precision Finding to see exactly where she is. It‚Äôs also helped when I had a brief scare during a thunderstorm and couldn‚Äôt find her right away.\n\nBattery life is excellent ‚Äî going strong after months of use ‚Äî and I love that the battery is user-replaceable. I paired the tag with a soft AirTag collar holder so it doesn‚Äôt bother my cats, and it adds almost no extra weight.\n\nOf course, it‚Äôs not a GPS tracker with real-time updates every second, but for everyday use and casual pet tracking, it's more than enough. And for keys, bags, or luggage? Totally essential.\n\nHighly recommended for both everyday item tracking and anyone who wants to keep a better eye on curious pets. Apple nailed it with this one.",
            "My fianc√© is a professional bronc rider, which means his gear bag travels more miles than most of us do in a year‚Äîand trust me, that bag has a serious habit of playing hide-and-seek at airports, hotels, and random rodeo arenas. Enter the Apple AirTag: the tiny, mighty tracker that‚Äôs officially saved his gear (and my sanity).\n\nüêÇ Why This Little Gadget is a Game-Changer\nThe AirTag is so small and sleek, it slipped right into his gear bag without taking up any space or catching on anything. No more panicked ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my gearbag?!‚Äù texts at 2 a.m. because the tracker‚Äôs precision and the Find My app show exactly where the bag is‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs hiding under a pile of sweaty chaps or saddles.\n\nüì± Easy Setup & Rockstar Battery Life\nSet up took less time than it takes to mount a bull (and that‚Äôs saying something). Plus, the battery lasts forever‚ÄîI swear, we haven‚Äôt had to replace it yet, and he‚Äôs been riding and traveling for months.\n\nüéØ Accuracy: Bullseye Every Time\nWhether he‚Äôs loading gear into a rental car or dropping the bag in a hotel room corner, the AirTag nails the location like a seasoned rider making a 90 point bronc ride. It even pinged him when he walked past his bag in a crowded arena‚Äîpure magic.\n\nü§† Peace of Mind for the Whole Team\nKnowing the gear is trackable means fewer headaches for him and way less nagging from me. (Okay, maybe a little less.) It‚Äôs the kind of gadget every rodeo contestant‚Äîor anyone who travels with valuable stuff‚Äîneeds.\n\nüéâ Final Verdict\nIf your loved one is out there chasing rodeo dreams and dodging lost luggage nightmares, get them an Apple AirTag. It‚Äôs small, smart, and tough‚Äîjust like a good bronc rider.\n\nFive stars for saving the day (and the gear)!",
            "First of all I'm an Apple fanboy and love all their products cooperate and work so well together as a system. But this is my first couple of AirTags.\n\nSince other people have explained how the AirTag works and how to set it up, I won't repeat here. There are so many potential uses for AirTags. My first use is for hidden attachment to my mobility scooter to track it if it is stolen while I'm in a store or restroom where my scooter won't go. Although it has a key to lock the \"ignition\", it can still be rolled or lifted away. I'm also looking at locks, but the cables can be cut. So the AirTag is just another (perhaps unneeded) level of protection and peace of mind. Those with bikes could use one in a similar way.\n\nI'm not sure what I'll use the other one for, but until then it'll be in my SUV. I don't travel by plane anymore, so it will not be used for tracking luggage. But might use it for tracking packages to family and friends.",
            "I keep this in my solo travel backpack to be able to have piece of mind for my traveling, also amazing in suitcases. One drawback these products only work if you are in range of other iphones so if you are traveling to a remote place, they may not work. In remote areas (e.g. nature, foreign rural areas, or airports in low-service zones), no nearby iPhones = no tracking updates. So consider other options if that is the case. However, for airport travel and transit it is a good staple to have just in case. I keep one in my luggage (if I am traveling with one) and in my backpack. I still give it 5 stars because it gives me reassurance and did save me when the airport lost my bag and they couldn't locate it. They were able to retrieve my bag way faster due to me telling them where it is through the find my app."

            "WAY LONG REVIEW, BUT ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT, SO‚Ä¶\n\nTL;DR: Apple AirPods Pro 2s actually help ‚Äúturn down the volume‚Äù of my life-long tinnitus. YMMV‚Ä¶ So, for those of us crusty old codgers with beat up ears, here's an interesting discovery I made today:\n\nI (unsurprisingly) listen to a lot of stuff while working out in my shop. And as a DOACA (\"Dude of a Certain Age\") who worked as a roadie & stage tech in the age of Grunge, I have pretty pronounced tinnitus, so I'm doubly careful about my hearing when using some of my larger shop tools, like my cabinet saw, mill, etc, which means I'm often putting hearing protection on, and taking it off repeatedly. I have a decent \"bone conduction\" headset that allows for environmental awareness, but the protectors don't work with those on. I have tried a few wireless earbuds (most recently the well reviewed certain-Lab ‚ÄúMini‚Äùs) but there was some problem or other with all of them (the Minis sound great, but have terrible connectivity).\n\nSo I finally sucked it up and got a set of Apple AirPod Pro 2s (yeah, mostly after hearing Adam Savage rave about them in a recent video you can easily find.) An interesting thing about them is that Apple actually worked with the US FDA (for those of you not in America, that's the federal agency that regulates medical devices here in the States‚Äîyou need to be certified by them to make any medical claims about a product or device) and got these to be certified as Class II hearing aids in the US and Canada. And in addition to a clinical-grade hearing test feature included that runs in the app, the Hearing Aid feature is easy to employ, and actually useful. But that's not what has me so jazzed about these.\n\nAside from the Bluetooth being rather astounding (my wife took my phone to the other end of the house about 40' away, with our chimney stack between us, and stuck it in her sock drawer‚Äîtotally fine), the noise cancellation is *shockingly* good. And this is where things get interesting, and where we get back around to my tinnitus.\n\nPutting these in my ears this morning while sitting in my dining area, next to our furnace closet with the HVAC running, the ANC immediately kicked in. And even with no music or sound playing, the furnace noise (I'd guess about ~50dB) just... *disappeared*. I literally had to take them out and put them back in a few times to see if I was going a bit bonkers. But not only did that sound disappear, but my tinnitus‚Äîa group of between five and seven tones of various frequencies between 4kHz - 8/9kHz that has a perceived volume of about 40dB all the time‚Äîsuddenly had its volume \"turned down\" by about 10-15dB.\n\nIt was rather startling.\n\nI've heard those tones from the age of 17 on (I'm now 57). Incessantly. Unforgivingly. Perpetually.\n\nFor them to get quieter was pretty amazing.\n\nI suspect that the Active Noise Cancellation is at play here. If you're not aware, AirPods have microphones built into them. The main, obvious ones, are the little sticks that come off them outside your ears that listen to the environment around them. But there is a second set of microphones that detect the sounds *inside your ear canal when the buds are in them* that are likely the heroes here. The buds take both of those sound profiles (technically, it's *four* sound signatures‚Äîtwo for each ear) and then uses machine learning combined with Apple's H2 chip to create \"anti-noise.\"\n\nNow, anti-noise is nothing new: I mean, *that's how ANC works*. It's also nothing new to tinnitus sufferers, either. \"Noise generators\" have been around for decades. There are even apps available that allow you to pump white, gray, pink, brown, or other noise \"colors,\" or other environmental sounds (ocean waves, rain, fireplace crackling, etc) into your ears -via- buds throughout the day to \"mask\" tinnitus. Many people have decent luck with this kind of tinnitus self-treatment‚ÄîI never have.\n\nI suspect that it's the inner microphones (Apple is one of a handful of current makers that have this) that are really helping to effectively mask the sound that gets past the bud seals, combined with (love 'em or hate 'em) Apple's crazy level of R&D that gets these buds to analyze not only the environmental noise profile *outside* the buds, but the sound that *gets past the buds*. This winds up being a broader noise profile, so the buds generate a broader palate of anti-noise, and then puts it *right in your ear*.\n\nNow to be clear, I can still hear my tinnitus tones. They're just less present in the... what? *\"auditory mix\"* in my head. But boy oh boy is the change noticeable. At least for now. It may be that in time my ears get used to the trick. But as of right now? I'm fine with being fooled.\n\nIt may be that other buds with ANC also do this, but I can't speak to any other solutions except the comparison to my -Labs. I get nothing if you buy these or any other buds. This is just my experience, but as someone who's lived with this affliction for so long, ANY positive change is important enough for me to take time, write down, and share my experience. YMMV.\n\nIf you have tinnitus, or hearing problems (or suspect you might) these are a serious consideration.",
            "First, please comment if you have any questions and I would love to respond to help!\n\nI had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.\n\nThe Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.\n\nThe battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.\n\nI personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.\n\nAs an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. I have noticed recently how good the sound quality is. It‚Äôs stunning. Sometimes I still prefer my Maxes for certain listening experiences or if I‚Äôm heavily invested in a movie or I have a long flight, but the quality on the 2nd gen pros is so crisp. Some pitches you can notice are superior to that of the Maxes. In terms of listen, Maxes win, but it‚Äôs so damn close. AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, discrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.\n\nThe AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.\n\nLong story short, if you‚Äôre on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.\n\nHope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!"

            "I recently ordered the Amazon Fire Stick, and after using it for a couple of weeks, I can confidently say it outperforms several of its competitors in both ease of use and value.\n\nI‚Äôve used Roku and Chromecast in the past, and while they each have their strengths, the Fire Stick really hits the sweet spot. Unlike Chromecast, which relies heavily on casting from another device, the Fire Stick gives you a fully independent interface and remote control‚Äîmaking it much more convenient for quick browsing and launching apps directly from your TV. Compared to Roku, I find the Fire Stick's voice control through Alexa more responsive and useful, especially when searching across multiple streaming platforms at once.\n\nWhat truly sets the Fire Stick apart for me are the small, thoughtful features:\n\nAlexa Voice Remote ‚Äì Super handy! I can launch apps, search titles, and even control smart home devices just by speaking.\n\nPersonalized Home Screen ‚Äì It learns what I like and suggests content I actually want to watch.\n\nSpeed & Performance ‚Äì Streaming is fast and reliable, with little to no buffering‚Äîeven on higher-res content.\n\nPortable & Travel-Friendly ‚Äì I took it with me on a recent trip and just plugged it into the hotel TV. Boom‚Äîmy shows, my apps, my settings.\n\nApp Variety ‚Äì Every streaming app I use regularly is available: Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Spotify, YouTube‚Äîyou name it.\n\nFor the price, it‚Äôs honestly one of the best streaming devices out there. Whether you‚Äôre upgrading your old setup or turning a ‚Äúdumb‚Äù TV into a smart one, the Fire Stick is a fantastic choice. It‚Äôs user-friendly, packed with features, and more flexible than many other options in its price range.\n\nHighly recommended!",
            "Sinceramente, no ten√≠a grandes expectativas cuando compr√© este producto. Pens√© que ser√≠a algo b√°sico o regular, pero me llev√© una grata sorpresa. Desde que lo empec√© a usar, me di cuenta de que funciona perfectamente y que realmente vale la pena. Todo lo que promete, lo cumple, y adem√°s con muy buena calidad.\n\nEs raro encontrar algo que supere lo que uno espera, pero este producto lo logr√≥. Sin exagerar, lo recomendar√≠a con total confianza. Una compra que realmente me dej√≥ satisfecho.",
            "I am very happy that I purchased this product. Now I can control streaming and TV with my Alexa Echo and Echo Dot. The installation from my Alexa app was very seamless. I can use Alexa to search for my movies and play my music on my TV or other devices. Buffering is good I only have buffering issues when my signal gets low, depending on the distance from my Wi-Fi. My sound quality is good from my sound bar or Echo. It boots rapid without any gliches. Use your Alexa app to connect your device the internet. The device is easy to tranfer from one TV to the next.",
            "Love this item, works great, easy to use and configure as needed. Well documented if there are questions or issues. Not had any issues that i can remember. Great picture, remote is simple and easy to use. Able to install all of the apps that we use for entertainment. Have them on all but my main TV where I have a Fire cube instead. Will get others as needed.",
            "As usual (this is our 4th Fire Stick), it is a pain to install. It always seems to get stuck in an update loop. For each and every Fire Stick, if has taken at least 30 minutes for updates. You do an update, install and try to use it and there is another update/install. For the same 'system components'. This happened 3 times. Then the Prime Video app needed updating. Say what? It got stuck on that, so we just powered down, came back up and all seemed to be fine. When I bought this one, the page said it was up to date. How often are updates done, anyway?\n\nWe selected the option to bring our old stick stuff over. Yeah, right. It didn't do that until we actually had to pick apps for our streaming. It seems that each stick is more difficult to install. There may be something good about smart TVs if you don't have to go through the aggravation of this thing!\n\nWe gave up on using a PIN. It is probably us, but we could not figure out how to pick a pin, let alone validate (repeat entry) of one. So glad we really don't need one.\n\nOnce this is installed, it is great. They all have been, barring the occaisonal unplug to clear cache because it is in never-never land.",
            "Our former Amazon Fire TV Stick performed so well and was such a pleasure to use, but it had reached the end of its support life from Amazon - no more updates. This new Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is a direct replacement and almost identical, but appears to be much improved in operation. It was 'almost' easy to install the new 'stick' - it retained all the app listings, but each app had to be reinstalled when opened in the menu list which meant that user names/passwords had to be re-entered... as an 'advanced-age' senior I had to actually use 'memory cells' that had not been accessed in YEARS!!! It all went smoothly and within ~30 minutes I had everything ready to go! The new Amazon Fire TV Stick HD has much better screen responsiveness when moving between apps and for some reason unknown to me provides better sound reproduction than the former Fire Stick on the same TV... maybe, like me, 'AGE' had effected its ability to 'function' properly?? As with our other Amazon-linked products they perform flawlessly and accordingly, I highly recommend the new Amazon Fire TV Stick HD."

            "Connectivity: very easy to pair. Once you pull the tab, it goes straight into pairing mode and your phone instantly detects AirTag available to pair. You can label it, which can then be found in the find my app. For example, I have an AirTag on my bike and a buddy of mine use the bike for a little bit. In the app, you can set the device or whatever the AirTag is attached to as lost. As long as it is within range of another Apple device, it can connect to it and use its GPS to send signals so you can track it.\n\nBattery life: have used the AirTags about six months now and still going strong. Very easy to change out the button cell battery highly recommend getting a lithium ion for longer battery life.\n\nSpeaker: one of the options when trying to find the device, the AirTag is attached to as utilizing a speaker. Compared to other products on the market, this is probably the quietest speaker which makes it hard to locate at a distance. Especially if this is in a wallet, the sound is severely muted compared to other wallet, friendly devices that are on the market.\n\nOverall: despite Apple‚Äôs history of proprietary use, these AirTags are highly serviceable and useful when tracking down lost items. You were able to pinpoint the location of the item using the app, there are new features (software related) Which don‚Äôt require manual updates compared to other devices. Highly recommend to anyone who throws their keys and wallet into the void.",

It integrates seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem, works great worldwide, and provides peace of mind every time I fly.",
            "Can't have enough AirTags!! They are easy to set up for luggage, golf bags, purse, keys, whatever you want! The \"finder\" beep is easy to hear as my husband misplace his and we found it in the bottom of his golf bag. I always order the keychain and waterproof holders to go with the AirTags. These make great gifts for your Apple friends. I have not had any issues with any of the tags. It's nice to land at an airport, go to \"Find My\" on my phone and know that my luggage has arrived with me. Once, it did not and I was able to be assured that it was at my last connection.",

The Precision Finding feature, available on select iPhone models, provides directional guidance to your tagged items. For those concerned about privacy, Apple ensures that all location data is encrypted and anonymous.

            "My first batch was purchased a couple of years ago and they were truly helpful in keeping track of our luggage during flights. Afterwards, I kept my keys safe with one of them.

Also I would love to add that I haven't had a problem of device over heating as compared to the other. Any apps you have subscribed to all show up under one setting , but with a little scrolling over on the screen you can go straight to the app you want or just explore under all streaming contents. I can't believe it took me so long to buy this! I got a deal during black friday and it came with xbox gaming so i had to have it! and again like i stated I'm in love with this little device! the Fire stick also has controls that you can speak into and take you right where you wanted! My 7-year-old is learning to spell better and this helps her! We encourage our kids to tyep it out first and if they can't remember how to spell a certain word the remote helps them and they DO REMEMBER after that how to spell \"said word\" it's so great I honestly can't recommend it more! It connects to smart tv's, if you are unsure whether it will with yours or not just ask an associate online to chat to on Amazon or call they will let you know for sure if you are undecided.

            "I should have bought this a long time ago. It turned my 11-year-old 31-inch TV into a smart TV. I can't say enough good things about it. We were in the \"Should we get rid of cable TV\" circumstance like so many other people. During the time we were having that discussion, we went with a new phone carrier that gave us everything we wanted, 5 bars 5G just about everywhere, and it works in Europe just like we're at home in Philadelphia. With that service, we were given Apple TV+ and basic Netflix. We have Prime Video and Disney as well.\n\nOne problem was that Apple TV would not work when streaming. The program would open, and immediately present a dialogue that it couldn't play, and bail out. That was from three different phones and two televisions. The second problem was that basic Netflix won't stream with Chromecast (if I'm getting it for free, I am certainly NOT going to pay for it!). So I went out and spent a couple of hundred $ on a 55-inch smart TV for the family room, which is nice, but I didn't have to spend the money.\n\nThe new problem was that we couldn't watch Netflix in the bedroom, because we couldn't stream it. I was giving away an old 31-inch Panasonic TV on Facebook Marketplace, and the guy taking it wanted to confirm that it worked. His wife was going to be in the hospital for an estimated 8 weeks, so I was willing to work with him. I hooked it up on my workbench in the garage, and he pulled an Amazon Fire TV Stick out of his pocket. Suddenly, that old TV was a Smart TV! I walked in the house and bought one!\n\nAt the end of the day, for $49.99 ($17.00 for me with a gift card balance), the TV in our bedroom is a Smart TV. It does literally everything the Big Brand 55-inch Smart TV does. We have access to all of our services, the Fire Stick remote controls everything, and is a Voice remote."

            "I absolutely love these AirPods! I‚Äôve been using them daily for about a month now, and they‚Äôre holding up really well. When they arrived, the box was slightly scuffed, which initially had me a little concerned‚Äîbut it was fully sealed, and the AirPods themselves were spotless and clearly brand new.\n\nThe sound quality is fantastic‚Äîcrisp highs, solid mids, and the bass is surprisingly punchy for such tiny earbuds. I upgraded from the 2nd generation, and the difference in sound is noticeable‚Äîespecially with how much clearer and fuller the low end feels. If you're someone who cares about audio quality, these are a huge step up.\n\nThey fit super well in my ears, which was something I was nervous about at first. For reference, I used to use the standard wired Apple EarPods, and these fit almost identically‚Äîso if those worked for you, these likely will too. I move around a lot throughout the day, whether I‚Äôm cleaning, working out, cooking, or getting ready, and I haven‚Äôt had them fall out once. Super secure and really comfortable‚Äîeven after a few hours of continuous use.\n\nBattery life has been great so far. I use them for around 4 to 6 hours a day, and usually just pop them back into the case once during that time. They charge really fast, and when I take them out again, they‚Äôre fully charged and ready to go. I only have to charge the case every couple of days‚Äîusually every 1 to 3 days depending on my usage‚Äîand even on the second day without charging, the case still has around 30% left. Really impressive battery performance overall.\n\nThey‚Äôre also super convenient for everyday use and perfect for travel because they‚Äôre so compact. Just a heads-up though: their small size does mean they‚Äôre easier to misplace, so I‚Äôd recommend being extra careful when out and about.\n\nOne thing I do want to point out is that if you accidentally drop the case, the AirPods tend to pop out. That‚Äôs my only real complaint. I‚Äôd highly recommend getting a protective cover for the case‚Äînot just to help with that issue, but also because it‚Äôs a fun way to personalize them to your style.\n\nThe pairing process was seamless. They connected to my iPhone instantly, no hiccups or delays. The microphone works great too‚Äîclear on calls, and no one‚Äôs had any trouble hearing me. Phone call quality overall is excellent, and switching between music and calls is smooth and fast.\n\nAlso, the range is solid. I‚Äôve been able to move around my apartment without losing connection, even with a few walls in between. The case feels durable and high-quality‚Äînot flimsy or cheap at all.\n\nAll in all, I‚Äôm super happy with this purchase. I was a little nervous at first because of some mixed reviews I‚Äôd seen, but I‚Äôm glad I trusted my gut. These AirPods have exceeded my expectations. I‚Äôd give them a 10/10‚Äîhonestly, probably a 10000000/10 if I could. Comfortable, reliable, great sound, and easy to use. Highly recommend!",
            "Pros\n‚Ä¢ Enhanced Audio Experience: The integration of the H2 chip delivers richer bass and clearer mids, providing a more immersive listening experience. Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking further enhances the soundstage, making music and calls feel more lifelike.\n‚Ä¢ Comfortable Design: Redesigned for a better fit, the AirPods 4 offer improved comfort for extended wear. The new contour and shorter stem contribute to a more secure and comfortable fit.\n‚Ä¢ Seamless Apple Ecosystem Integration: Effortless setup and automatic switching between Apple devices make using the AirPods 4 a breeze for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users.\n‚Ä¢ Improved Durability: With an IP54 rating, the AirPods 4 are more resistant to dust, sweat, and water, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities.\n‚Ä¢ USB-C Charging Case: The inclusion of a USB-C charging case aligns with modern charging standards, providing faster and more convenient charging options.\n\nCons\n‚Ä¢ Limited Noise Cancellation in Standard Model: The standard AirPods 4 lack Active Noise Cancellation, which may be a drawback for users seeking immersive sound in noisy environments.\n‚Ä¢ Battery Life with ANC: The ANC model offers up to 4 hours of listening time with noise cancellation enabled, which is less than some competitors.\n‚Ä¢ Open-Back Design: The open-back design allows ambient noise, which might not be ideal for users seeking complete isolation.",
            "The Apple AirPods 4 are a total win! The sound quality is amazing Personalized Spatial Audio makes music and calls feel immersive and crisp. The H2 chip ensures fast pairing and ultra-smooth performance, and the USB-C charging case is a nice upgrade.\n\nThey‚Äôre sweat and water resistant, which makes them perfect for workouts or running in light rain. Plus, the battery life is outstanding‚ÄîI can easily get up to 30 hours with the case. Setup with my iPhone was effortless, just like all Apple devices.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre listening to music, taking calls, or using Siri, these AirPods deliver top-tier quality in every way. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for comfort, clarity, and Apple-level convenience!",
            "After updating our iPhones and iPads I discovered that the most convenient way to listen to music, etc. is EarPods. With no knowledge of differences between versions I picked this one. I have not been disappointed. The setup was easy, and the wireless performance is quite good. I especially like the fact that I can hear if someone talks to me. It still maintains good quality sound while competing. Glad I selected this.",
            "I recently upgraded to the AirPods 4, and I'm thoroughly impressed. The sound quality is noticeably better‚Äîcrisp highs, deep bass, and excellent clarity for both music and calls. The new design is more comfortable and secure in my ears, even during workouts or long listening sessions. The durability of them are great for someone like me who drops things frequently\n\nBattery life is solid‚ÄîI easily get through the day with a single charge, and the case recharges quickly. The noise cancellation and transparency modes are also top-notch. It‚Äôs super easy to switch between Apple devices too, which is a big plus. Also the connectivity is never an issue\n\nIf you're thinking about upgrading from an older version or trying AirPods for the first time, I highly recommend the AirPods 4. Apple really nailed it with this one!"

            "I recently upgraded to the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max, and I couldn't be more pleased with my decision.

It's sleek and easy to hold, with well-placed buttons that are sensitive to touch.

It offers an exceptional streaming experience with its outstanding functionality, audio quality, and user-friendly design. If you're looking to elevate your home entertainment, I highly recommend this device!",
            "I‚Äôve been a long-time user of Fire TV devices, and the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is by far the best one yet! If you're looking for a powerful streaming device that delivers ultra-fast performance, stunning 4K visuals, and seamless navigation, this is it.\n\nUnboxing & First Impressions\nRight out of the box, the setup was effortless. Amazon makes it super easy‚Äîjust plug it into an HDMI port, connect to Wi-Fi, and you're good to go. The remote feels comfortable in hand, and I immediately noticed that the build quality is solid, with a premium feel.\n\nPerformance & Speed ‚Äì A Game Changer!\nThe biggest upgrade here is Wi-Fi 6E support, and trust me, you will notice the difference. Streaming is buttery smooth, with no buffering, even when switching between apps or playing 4K HDR content. The quad-core processor makes navigating menus and loading apps feel instant, unlike previous models where you‚Äôd sometimes experience lag.\n\nPicture & Sound ‚Äì Pure Immersion\nIf you have a 4K TV, you‚Äôre in for a treat! This Fire Stick supports Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Dolby Atmos, making everything look crisp and vibrant. Whether I‚Äôm watching Netflix, Prime Video, or YouTube, the colors are rich, and the details are sharp. The audio quality is just as impressive‚Äîespecially for those with a surround sound system.\n\nLive TV Without Cable? Yes, Please!\nOne of the best features is the free and live TV options, eliminating the need for cable or satellite. Apps like Pluto TV, Freevee, and Tubi offer a great selection of channels and movies at no cost. Plus, if you have a subscription to Sling, Hulu Live, or YouTube TV, everything integrates seamlessly into the Fire TV interface.\n\nAlexa Voice Remote ‚Äì So Convenient!\nThe Alexa Voice Remote is a game-changer. Instead of endlessly scrolling through menus, I can just say, \"Alexa, play The Office,\" and it launches instantly. You can also control your smart home devices, check the weather, and even dim the lights while watching a movie.\n\nPros & Cons\nPros:\nUltra-fast performance with Wi-Fi 6E and a powerful processor\nVibrant 4K HDR picture quality with Dolby Vision & HDR10+\nDolby Atmos support for immersive sound\nSmooth and responsive navigation with no lag\nExtensive free live TV options ‚Äì No cable needed!\nAlexa Voice Remote makes searching effortless\nCompact & travel-friendly ‚Äì Take it anywhere!\n\nCons:\nRequires a Wi-Fi 6E router to fully take advantage of the fastest speeds\nNo expandable storage for apps (though cloud-based streaming minimizes the need)\n\nFinal Verdict ‚Äì Worth Every Penny!\nThe Fire TV Stick 4K Max (Newest Model) is hands down the best Fire TV device yet. If you‚Äôre upgrading from an older model or looking for a top-tier streaming stick, this is a no-brainer. The speed, picture quality, and live TV options make it worth every penny. Highly recommend!",
            "This isn‚Äôt a streaming stick. It‚Äôs a relationship ender. A social life obliterator. A productivity assassin. Since plugging in the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, I‚Äôve entered a committed relationship with my television. My couch has developed a me-shaped groove. I think my dog forgot my face.\n\nSetup was easier than lying to yourself about \"just watching one episode.\" I clicked a few buttons, Wi-Fi 6E kicked in like a caffeine fueled squirrel, and boom, my screen was flooded with more content than my brain has capacity to absorb.\n\nThe remote even talks to me now. Literally. I asked Alexa to find thrillers and she didn‚Äôt just recommend movies, she recommended life choices. I think she‚Äôs trying to help.\n\nThanks to all the free and live TV, I cut the cord faster than a drama queen in a group chat. No more cable. No more satellite. Just me, my Fire Stick, and a slowly deteriorating sense of time.\n\nIf you need me, I‚Äôll be somewhere between season 4 of a show I started this morning and the existential void that comes after the series finale.\n\n10/10, would binge again."

            "This works great, all plugs and ports are functional. The power switch at the back is nice for when you don't need any of the cords but don't want to unplug them. I use this for easy travel, just unplug from the wall and roll up the cords before packing. Then it's all ready to go when I arrive at my destination; no fumbling with multiple wall adapters or struggling to locate enough outlets in decent locations in older buildings.\n\nI have noticed a high pitched noise coming from it when I have devices charging but that's the only downside.",
            "More and more we need power strips to plug in all our stuff-everythng is electric! But as the years have passed, those classic outlets are less necessary than a good set of USB inputs. I like this power cube because the design allows for multiple plugs, even more access than your typical strip which can get filled quickly with all the oversized plugs. And the appropriate number of USB ports allows for a few less bricks in the collection.\nCord length is good, it keeps my stuff charged. Been using it for over a year now. Good stuff.",

            "Me encantan mis auriculares con cable. Aunque me encantan mis AirPods para escuchar m√∫sica mientras trabajo, no me sirven cuando necesito hacer una llamada. Estos tienen una gran claridad al hablar por tel√©fono, son c√≥modos incluso en mis orejas inusualmente peque√±as y la conectividad es genial. Este es mi segundo par; el primero se desgast√≥ hasta el cable, e incluso as√≠ me duraron varios meses a pesar de que el cable estaba expuesto. No puedo hablar de la cancelaci√≥n de ruido, pero siempre que me cambio a estos despu√©s de que la gente diga que no me escucha con mis AirPods, estoy encantado. Duran mucho tiempo con cuidado; creo que mi primer par dur√≥ unos 3 a√±os con un uso semanal. Si no quieres se√±ales de wifi en la cabeza y necesitas mejor claridad en las llamadas, definitivamente consigue auriculares con cable.",
            "I still love a good pair of wired headphones and these are some of my favorites. I fell in love with these after they came with my iPhone 5C, very happy I can still buy a new pair, these are more difficult to misplace than earbuds and the remote control is a lifesaver.",
            "My second purchase of these wired earbuds. I use them for my Android phones, the first with my LG V60, so got the ones with the 3.5 headphone plug, and which has awesome audio quality, and I got the same earbuds with its type C plug for my new awesome Motorola Edge Plus 2023. My opinion only, but I've tried numerous other earbuds and to me these have by far the best audio quality of any buds I've tried/used even including much more expensive buds. Great balaced bass, midrange and high end response (but not \"tinny\" sounding at the top). These have formed buds so they may not fit all ears but for me they fit great and have excellent full sound quality. Highly recommend you try them but make sure to order the ones with the 3.5 plug, or the type C plug, depending on your phone.",
            "Its annoying that iPhones no longer come with a set of headphones, so when I upgraded to an iPhone 16 Pro Max and the port changed to a USB-C my old headphones no longer worked. I prefer wired headphones (call me old school) for work so that my co-workers know when I'm on a call (I have long hair that covers my ears). I also use to run into issues with my airpods disconnecting and I no longer have that issue with wired headphones.",

            "### **\"Compact Powerhouse: A Must-Have for Home, Office, and Travel!\"**\n\nI recently purchased the **QINLIANF Wall Charger Surge Protector** with **5 outlets** and **4 USB charging ports**, and it‚Äôs been a total game-changer for organizing and powering my devices. Here‚Äôs my detailed review after using it for several weeks.\n\n### **Design and Build**\nThe **3-sided design** of this power strip is perfect for maximizing space. The outlets are thoughtfully spaced out, so even larger plugs don‚Äôt block the neighboring outlets. This is a huge plus compared to standard power strips where larger adapters tend to crowd out other ports. It‚Äôs compact but functional, making it perfect for use in small spaces, whether at home, in the office, or when traveling.\n\nThe build quality feels solid and durable, and the **1680J surge protection** adds peace of mind, knowing that my electronics are safe from power surges. The sleek white design also blends nicely into any room without being too bulky or noticeable.\n\n### **Charging Capacity**\nWith **5 AC outlets** and **4 USB ports** (3 regular USB-A and 1 USB-C), this power strip can charge multiple devices simultaneously without overloading. I‚Äôve been using it to charge my phone, laptop, tablet, and a few smaller electronics, and it handles everything effortlessly.\n\nThe **USB ports** offer a combined total of **4.8A**, and they deliver fast and efficient charging. I especially love the inclusion of the **USB-C port**, which is perfect for newer devices. It‚Äôs great to have everything charged in one place without needing multiple adapters or cluttering my desk with chargers.\n\n### **Surge Protection**\nOne of the standout features is the **1680J surge protection**. This level of protection ensures that even during power surges or spikes, my devices are safe from damage. I‚Äôve experienced power fluctuations in my area, and knowing that my expensive electronics are protected gives me a lot of peace of mind.\n\n### **Perfect for Travel**\nBecause of its **compact size** and **multiple outlets**, this power strip is ideal for travel. It‚Äôs small enough to fit in a carry-on bag or suitcase, and the **multi-plug adapter** design means I can charge several devices at once in a hotel room or other travel locations. The built-in surge protector is also a bonus when traveling to places with unreliable or unstable power sources.\n\n### **Easy Installation**\nThe extender simply plugs into a standard wall outlet, and it stays securely in place. It has a **screw hole** at the top if you want to secure it more firmly to the outlet, which I did in one of my rooms for extra stability. There‚Äôs no complicated installation process‚Äîit‚Äôs truly plug-and-play.\n\n### **Pros**\n- **5 AC outlets**: Plenty of space to plug in multiple devices, with a smart 3-sided design for easy access.\n- **4 USB ports**: Includes 3 USB-A and 1 USB-C, offering fast and efficient charging for multiple devices.\n- **1680J surge protection**: Protects valuable electronics from power surges and spikes.\n- **Compact and travel-friendly**: Perfect for home use, but also compact enough to bring along when traveling.\n- **Sturdy and secure**: Fits snugly into the wall, with an optional screw to secure it more firmly.\n- **Fast charging**: The 4.8A output provides fast charging, even when charging multiple devices at once.\n\n### **Cons**\n- **USB ports share output**: While the combined output is 4.8A, heavy users charging multiple high-power devices (like tablets and phones) simultaneously may notice slightly slower charging times on all devices.\n- **No power cord**: It plugs directly into the wall, so if you need something with a cord for more flexible placement, this may not be ideal.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\nThe **QINLIANF Wall Charger Surge Protector** is a compact yet powerful solution for anyone looking to **organize and protect** their devices. Whether you're using it at home, in the office, or for travel, it offers a perfect combination of **multiple outlets**, **USB ports**, and **surge protection** in a space-saving design. If you‚Äôre tired of dealing with cluttered chargers and want peace of mind with surge protection, I highly recommend this product! It‚Äôs versatile, reliable, and efficient‚Äîeverything you could want in a power strip.",
            "This is a great addition to my electrical needs. It covers up a standard 2 outlet box. Gives you 5 outlets, 3 usb, and 1 usb-c charging ports. The center screw locks it in place well so you don't accidentally pull it out. Feels very sturdy once locked in. With all the new available power options just be sure not to overload the circuit. Make sure to read the instructions on its max capacity. It does have a built in surge protection too. But the manual still suggested to use a separate surge protector for any sensitive or very expensive devices just to be safe.",
            "So far, so good. Lots of different ports and doesn‚Äôt look bad on the eye.",
            "better description on the product is a must for technical options for this product",
            "Good",
            "Very good build quality. The power cord plugs fit tightly and don't wobble. I bought it to protect my audio equipment, so I don't know how well it will protect against power surges, but the stated 1680 J should be enough. It's a pity there's no EMI/FMI filter, which is usually included in surge protector circuits. USB ports work just fine. Overall, I like it so far.",
            "No more need to look in your drawers for those stupid little block chargers to power up and charge your devices. This has the USB ins right on there. I like the positioning as well. We purchased a second one once we saw the usability."

            "I honestly still love my Apple wired earbuds, even with all the wireless options out there. The sound quality is amazing‚Äîcrisp, clear, and just right for music. Whether I‚Äôm walking, commuting, or just relaxing, they never let me down. What really surprises me is how good the mic is. I‚Äôve had clearer phone calls with these than with my AirPods, no joke. People actually hear me better, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about them dying mid-conversation. Plus, no need to charge them‚Äîjust plug in and go. Sometimes, the classic way really is the best.",
            "These EarPods are a game-changer! The sound quality is fantastic, with clear highs and deep bass, making my music sound incredible. The design is super comfortable, fitting perfectly in my ears without causing any discomfort, even after hours of use.\n\nThe Lightning connector is a breeze to use, plugging in easily to my iPhone. The built-in remote is a convenient touch, allowing me to control the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls effortlessly.\n\nThe build quality feels premium, and they're durable enough to withstand daily wear and tear. For the price, you get amazing sound quality and a comfortable fit, making these EarPods a must-have for any iPhone user. Highly recommend!",
            "Works right out of the box (purchased for iphone 13 pro max)\nIt's very old school, being corded, but no worries about running out of battery life\nThe buds are comfortable in my ears\nSound is good whether using one or both buds\nWish it came with a storage box. Apparently that is a separate and fashion purchase\nLightweight, and I like that it is white.",
            "It‚Äôs exactly what I expected. I bought these for when I‚Äôm working remotely and don‚Äôt want to drain my Bluetooth headphones (or if I have issues with them).\n\nSo far they‚Äôre my go to if I have a last minute meeting and don‚Äôt want to risk the connectivity issues that come with wireless headphones. They‚Äôre a classic for a reason and so far - no issues. I always take them with me when traveling.",
            "Me encantan mis auriculares con cable. Aunque me encantan mis AirPods para escuchar m√∫sica mientras trabajo, no me sirven cuando necesito hacer una llamada. Estos tienen una gran claridad al hablar por tel√©fono, son c√≥modos incluso en mis orejas inusualmente peque√±as y la conectividad es genial. Este es mi segundo par; el primero se desgast√≥ hasta el cable, e incluso as√≠ me duraron varios meses a pesar de que el cable estaba expuesto. No puedo hablar de la cancelaci√≥n de ruido, pero siempre que me cambio a estos despu√©s de que la gente diga que no me escucha con mis AirPods, estoy encantado. Duran mucho tiempo con cuidado; creo que mi primer par dur√≥ unos 3 a√±os con un uso semanal. Si no quieres se√±ales de wifi en la cabeza y necesitas mejor claridad en las llamadas, definitivamente consigue auriculares con cable.",
            "I still love a good pair of wired headphones and these are some of my favorites. I fell in love with these after they came with my iPhone 5C, very happy I can still buy a new pair, these are more difficult to misplace than earbuds and the remote control is a lifesaver.",
            "My second purchase of these wired earbuds. I use them for my Android phones, the first with my LG V60, so got the ones with the 3.5 headphone plug, and which has awesome audio quality, and I got the same earbuds with its type C plug for my new awesome Motorola Edge Plus 2023. My opinion only, but I've tried numerous other earbuds and to me these have by far the best audio quality of any buds I've tried/used even including much more expensive buds. Great balaced bass, midrange and high end response (but not \"tinny\" sounding at the top). These have formed buds so they may not fit all ears but for me they fit great and have excellent full sound quality. Highly recommend you try them but make sure to order the ones with the 3.5 plug, or the type C plug, depending on your phone.",
            "Its annoying that iPhones no longer come with a set of headphones, so when I upgraded to an iPhone 16 Pro Max and the port changed to a USB-C my old headphones no longer worked. I prefer wired headphones (call me old school) for work so that my co-workers know when I'm on a call (I have long hair that covers my ears). I also use to run into issues with my airpods disconnecting and I no longer have that issue with wired headphones.",

            "I am 100% in the Apple ecosystem with Apple TV, iPad Pro, iPhone, and Apple watches. In fact, the whole family is and that‚Äôs why I picked up this watch. My first generation Apple Watch Ultra still works great but I really wanted to see how good The new watches were compared to the high-end ultra. Once I‚Äôve completed that test, I plan on gifting this to my mother. So how is it?\n\nThis 46 mm series 10 Apple Watch is almost as big as my series one ultra at less than half the price and I know this is a couple years newer, but it does a lot more than my ultra does with the exception of a few things. The health tracking seems to be a little bit better and the GPS is better. Also, it seems. I wore the ultra on my left wrist and the series 10 on my right and took off on my normal walk. I did this for five days in a row making sure I stayed on the same path I always take and it seemed that the series 10 was a lot more consistent With not only the steps but the mileage. The heart tracker on both watches are on par with each other, and even though I have tattoos that go down to my wrist, both watches seem to be able to see through them unlike some of the older watches where it would stop my workout because it couldn‚Äôt penetrate the ink.\n\nI am a big fan of being able to track my health and the Apple watches along with Apple health seem to keep a good track of my exercise trends, as well as all of my other health trends as much as I want to know. At the end of the day, I can‚Äôt say how this compares to the android devices because I have only owned the very first Android tracker and since then I have owned every series of Apple Watch that has been made. But comparing them against each other, they are pretty close meaning the series 10 and the ultra. I like the ruggedness of the ultra better as I am a pretty good size guy and I think the big watch With the titanium basil looks a lot more manly but being close to the same size this 46 mm Apple Watch series 10 looks pretty good on the wrist too. I love Apple and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about their products and I would 100% recommend this watch!",
            "I‚Äôve been using this Apple Watch (black, size small/medium band) for a few days now and I‚Äôm honestly impressed. I mainly got it to help me stay on top of my fitness goals and notifications without always being on my phone, and it‚Äôs done exactly that. The functionality is super smooth. It syncs easily with my iPhone, tracks my workouts accurately, and even gives gentle reminders to stand or breathe when I‚Äôve been sitting too long (which I actually appreciate more than I thought I would). I‚Äôve also used it for music control, checking texts, and even answering calls when my hands are full. Super convenient. Battery life is great. I get a full day‚Äôs use without worrying, sometimes even into the next day if I forget to charge it overnight. I was a little worried about scratching it up since I wear it every day, but so far the screen has held up really well with no scratches, even with light bumps here and there. The black band in the small/medium size fits comfortably and looks sleek. It goes with pretty much everything, whether I‚Äôm working out or dressed up a bit.\nIf you‚Äôre on the fence, I‚Äôd say go for it. Great value, especially for everything it can do in such a compact, stylish little package.",
            "I love my Series 10 watch. I hadn‚Äôt had a watch of any kind in 20 years and had no interest in an Apple Watch until not long before I bought this one.\n\nAfter a bit of time, I settled on a watch face that I use almost exclusively (the lunar face with digital time and seconds that light up around the circle). I think finding a watch face you like is particularly important.\n\nBeing able to look at the time without having to look at my phone is great, as is the ability to check how many seconds have passed in a given minute.\n\nI appreciate being able to look at my watch from an angle, though I don‚Äôt know any different since the Series 10 is my first Apple watch. I can read the time even if my watch is almost flat against my vision.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth getting a protective case for your watch. I liked my watch so much that I got my mom one; we both had cases. The cases were cracked around the same time and easily replaced with new cases. Much better than a watch repair.\n\nTexts and the heart rate monitor are my most used features. It‚Äôs also great at showing the time‚Äî no small thing.",
            "My daughter recently purchased the Apple Watch Series 10 as a replacement for her old watch, and she‚Äôs absolutely loving it! The sleek jet black aluminium case with the black sport band looks stylish, and the 42mm size is just right for her wrist. She loves the always-on Retina display, which makes it easy to check messages and notifications even when on the move. The fitness tracking features are incredibly accurate, and she uses the ECG app regularly to monitor her health. One of her favorite features is the ability to text and take calls directly from the watch, which keeps her connected without having to pull out her phone. Overall, it‚Äôs a fantastic all-in-one smartwatch that combines style, fitness, and convenience!",
            "My husband and I upgraded from series 5 to the 10. We decided to buy them outright this time since we weren‚Äôt going to do a cellular plan. It had been a few years, but it was so easy to set up and pair the new watch. It was also able to sync with my husbands last Apple watch update which he was happy about so he didn‚Äôt lose his data. We were up and running within 5 minutes. So simple. This face is a bit bigger than the old 5 he had and he likes it better. We are happy to upgrade!"

            "For more than nine years running, I have had Amazon Echo devices on every level of my home. An Amazon Echo lived in the kitchen, the family room, the office, and four bedrooms. All were Generation 1 devices, you know....the tall tower-like devices that if they fell would severely damage your foot!!!üò´ Then one day, all of my Generation 1 devices went off-line and ceased to function!!üòÆ I contacted Amazon for help, and was told the Generation 1 devices were no longer supported by Amazon and could not receive any updates. I can't comprehend how 7 separate devices just stopped working all at the same time. My entire family has come to depend on Alexa to play music, news, weather, podcasts, and many other apps we added to the mix. I ordered a new 5th-generation Echo Dot, and it was delivered overnight. Set-up was easy-peasy using my Alexa app on my phone. It was connected to my internet, and the settings were selected in just a few minutes. The sound from my old Echo was dynamic, but this new Echo Dot produces great-sounding music with the right blend of bass, mid-range tones, and highs brilliantly!!üòÉ This Echo Dot is small in its dimensions but VERY BIG IN PERFORMANCE!!!üòÑ The bass is deeper and more pronounced, and the mid-range vocals are more defined and clear!! This new Echo has exceeded my expectations regarding punching out some music!!! This first purchase of the Amazon Echo Dot was my test device, which, if great, would be purchased in greater quantity and set up in each room missing an Echo device.I believe I'll be ordering more of these to satisfy the family!!! The design is very pleasant to look at, and the rounded shape looks more at home than my previous 1st generation units!! I set the Echo so that if I was talking to the unit and stopped, I didn't have to say \"Alexa\" to wake the device. This unit waits for my next words seamlessly making commands flow much more smoothly!! You can also set whether the Echo, when woken, makes a sound or remains quiet. I like the awake notification especially if I'm not looking directly at the device. This Echo also has a temperature sensor which could make it more repsonsive if it were running a home thermostat!! I like the \"+\" and \"-\" bottons on the top of the device to control volume as opposed to turning the top of my old Echos to increase or decrease the volume. You can also, like the older models, use your voice to tell Alexa which level of volume you prefer. Whether you're playing music, listening to news, or getting a weather report, this device can be muted just by touching the top of the Echo!!! NICE FEATURE!!!!üòÉ It will remain muted until you touch the top again which will pick up where you stopped the unit!!! CONVENIENT!!!!üòâ I have also found that this newer generation Echo is much more responsive to voice commands and follows through with exactly you asked for in a flash!!! I discovered that if I didn't know how to install an app or function, or wasn't aware of what's available to run on the unit, Alexa is on the job either describing apps or functions she can perform, or she can tell me how to set up an app or functions in easy to follow clear directions!!!!üòâ I haven't in the past set up lights or the house thermostat, but since this Echo seems better suited to the tasks than my previous generation devive, I think I'll venture into the world of Alexa controlled convenience items!!! üö©I rate this new 5th Generation Echo Dot a super-solid 10 out of 10, because of the units ease of set-up, the quick and crisp responses from Alexa, the improved sound whether playing music or even just news, the addition of volume controls on the topo of this device, and the affordable price of this amazingly handy device!!!! I highly recommend this new 5th Generation Echo Dot to anyone who has gone through the same situation as I with my older devices shutting down, or to new first time buyers that have yet to experience the convenience and helpfulness of owning an Amazon Echo device!!! I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed in the least with the function and performance of this newest generation Echo device!!!!üòä",
            "My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.\n\nSo, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 ‚Äì aside from familiarity with the brand ‚Äì was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.\n\nFirst thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room ‚Äì the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.\n\nFirst thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.\n\nSo after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.\n\nI can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say ‚Äì though I may be wrong about this ‚Äì that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only ‚Äì at this point anyway ‚Äì required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.\n\nNow, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter ‚Äì I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal ‚Äì also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important ‚Äì add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!\n\nAnother new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.\n\nThere is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.\n\nOne borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections ‚Äì they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.\n\nOnce again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome \"drop-in\" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!",
            "Absolutely Love My Alexa!\n\nI couldn‚Äôt be happier with my purchase! Alexa has truly transformed my home into a smart and more convenient space. From playing music, setting reminders, checking the weather, controlling my lights, and even answering random questions ‚Äî it does it all with ease. The voice recognition is spot-on, even from across the room, and the sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for such a compact device.\n\nSetup was quick and seamless, and I love how well it integrates with my other smart devices. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant 24/7. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their home with a touch of voice-activated tech.\n\nIf you‚Äôre on the fence ‚Äî go for it! You won‚Äôt regret it."

            "I've had this for a few months now and it is still great. It is great quality. Fully functional, including the USB ports. The cord seems like it will never fail - its thick and braided, but also more on the flat side. The cord is not bulky or anything, its easy to keep it tucked away. Appearance-wise, it also looks nice. Everything is still white and clean looking.\n\nThe usb-c ports \"fast\" charge my Samsung phone. The usb-c ports are 5v/3a, and usb-a ports are 5v/2.4a. The specs say the output for the ports are 15.5w. However, my phone requires 18w to \"fast\" charge, so I dont know if that's a good or bad thing lol. (I'm no electrician, just self-educated on charging blocks, usb cables, device charging capabilities and power delivery.)\n\nI did pay a little more than what it costs now, as it was a few months ago. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and at the time, it was a great price for what I was getting. Now at $10, its still a bargain for anyone.\n\nWith the new one out now (and competitors), I'd be interested in looking into the usb capabilities. I didn't think of the long run with using the usb ports or that I would end up using them as much as I do. Better usb output is definitely something to consider if looking at these. It would be nice if I could \"super fast\" charge my phone with this, but it is just incapable of the appropriate output.\n\nAlthough I'd like to get more out of the usb ports, I'm putting my bias aside and rating it for what it promises to be (and is), I honestly cannot give it less than 5 stars.",
            "I bought this HANYCONY Surge Protector Power Strip to help organize the chaos of cables at my home office desk, and it‚Äôs honestly one of the best purchases I‚Äôve made this year. The 8 outlets are well-spaced and versatile, so I can plug in my laptop, monitor, lamp, and chargers without any of them getting in the way of each other. The 4 USB ports, especially the 2 USB-C ones, are super handy‚ÄîI can charge my phone, headphones, and tablet without reaching for wall bricks anymore.\n\nThe 5-foot braided cord feels really sturdy, and the flat plug is a nice touch since it fits behind my desk without sticking out. I mounted it on the side of my desk with the included keyhole slots, and it‚Äôs been great for keeping things tidy. I also like knowing it has surge protection‚Äîit gives me peace of mind when I‚Äôve got all my gear plugged in. For the price, it really does feel like a steal. Highly recommend it if you‚Äôre looking to clean up your workspace!",
            "10/10 would recommend this to anyone I know. I have bought several of them since my initial purchase.\nThis power block is small enough to fit on a desk and not take up room. Its plug capacity is amazing. I am a gamer and I work remotely and it fits all of my electronics!\n\nI have one for mine and my husbands desks, mine sits on my desk but his sits in a basket under his desk. So, its small enough to fit in a basket.\n\nThe plugs facing multiple directions give this thing so much versatility, plus it has the USB ports so i can also charge my phone without needing a wall charger block!\n\nThe power cord is sturdy anti-rip material, so i never have to worry about that issue that other cords get after a few months where the wires start to show at the base.\n\nAbsolutely love this product!",
            "I've been trying to find the perfect power strip where I can plug in four single-port USB C PD adapters. Why individuals? Because many cut power to devices and reset themselves when cables are attached and/or disconnected.\n\nThe problem with power strips is the space between outlets. (Isn't it always!!!!?)\n\nSo, this one works for the adapters I am using but just barely. It's not ideal but I'm going with it in my travel kit until I can find something better and preferably a bit smaller. (Yes, I want small but need larger spacing...)\n\nThe added outlets and USB A and C ports might come in handy. And so far it has performed as expected.\n\nBT recommended\n\nNow to find a larger travel box to fit this into...",
            "It is useful when it works. I liked being able to plug things in or turn things on and off without getting out of bed. the outlets in my bedroom are mostly hard to reach because they're blocked by furniture. This can be plugged into the wall outlet once, so that I only have to crawl under the bed to plug it in once. Then I can have the other end where I can reach it without crawling under the bed and struggling to get a plug plugged in between the wall and a cross brace that just happens to be at the perfect level to interfere with the electrical outlets on my walls, and the bed is right next to the wall and about 3/4 the length of the wall, so that cross brace was always going to block an electrical outlet no matter where in my room I put it. Anyway, now instead of struggling to find the outlet and than trying to get a 2 inch long plug into a 1 inch space and bending the cord at sharp angles, I can set this nice little box of extra outlets anywhere within 5 feet of the wall outlet. The extension cord is just long enough to reach between the upper bed rails of my loft bed. Right now I have my Chromebook and 2 fans and a tiny led desk lamp plugged into the thing I'm reviewing. I often use it to charge my phone at night.\n\nThere's a little switch on this thing that has to be switched on for it to work, It's annoying, because sometimes that switch won't stay switched on. I have to hold it in position, which isn't very convenient, because usually I have other things I want to do with my hands. I struggled with that a little before starting this review, but eventually got the little green light to stay on. I think the extension cord was trying to come unplugged from the little box until I found a position it liked better. maybe a longer cord would be better, but for now it is working again.\n\nI could plug more things in, but it depends on what kind of plug they have."

            "I had a few friends and family who have been using Roku for a few years and had been trying to convert me for a while. I have been in the Amazon ecosystem for a long time and was very hesitant to abandon my Fire Stick... however, I was noticing that I had to replace my Fire Sticks about every 1-2 years because they would slow down and get very glitchy. Even with updates and full factory resets, nothing would bring them back to functioning like new. When it came time to replace my third Fire Stick within a 4-year span, I decided to make the jump to Roku.\n\nAll I can say is, I SHOULD HAVE SWITCHED SOONER! Upon setting up the Roku Stick, I started falling in love with it almost immediately. It was quick, responsive, easy to use... and it just \"worked.\" All of the apps that I am used to were easy to locate and download, plus I was excited to see the amount of no-charge content available to supplement my streaming apps, such as the Roku Live TV Channel.\n\nBest of all, I have had this streaming stick for months now and I see no slow-down or degradation of performance like I used to experience with the Fire Stick. This thing feels just as snappy as the day I started using it, and as corny as it sounds, using my Roku makes me look forward to turning on my TV when I am relaxing at night. As a side note, I have found that the Roku is also great for my AIrbnb because it features a \"Guest Mode\" so that I can allow guests to log in to their own accounts, while my own \"main\" profile remains protected and ready for me to switch back to once guests leave. I also love that when guests log out, it automatically wipes all of their personal log in and downloads of any apps that they used. What a smart feature.\n\nAll of this to say, I am so glad that I made the switch to Roku. I hope that they maintain this level of quality and keep innovating, because this is the kind of rare product that is a joy to use and truly enhances my entertainment experience.",
            "Spectrum every like 6 months raise their prices and my dad at some point said, enough with this so he started looking into lowering the price. We called them directly and they worked with the price, but when my dad started paying attention to the bill, he noticed a fee for the DVR box, which he was not told at any other time he has called before, so he called and he requested information about the DVR box, fee, and how to remove it from the bill. He found the answer from the rep \"remove the DVR box, get yourself ROKU, set it up with your Spectrum account and that's all, you'll save every month because the DVR fee will be removed\". I believe my dad told me it was like $28 a month. Anyway, he not only purchased 1, he end up getting another one for a different room where he had another DVR so you can understand the DVR fee DROPPED drastically. I do recommend the Roku Streaming Stick 4K. We needed the adapter so we emailed ROKU with the serial number for each box we own and they sent us the adapter for FREE. Read the instructions to find out what needs to be done to order the adapters for free! Since my family wanted to watch Telemundo, then ROKU worked, because my dad has a cable subscription with SPECTRUM, but if you don't have a cable subscription, you still can watch FREE TV using The Roku Channel, Tubi, Pluto TV, Plex, and Freevee. Also, you can use ROKU to stream apps like Netflix, HULU, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+ and more when you have a paid subscription!",
            "On the day before my departure, I received the Roku stick I ordered the night before. I tossed it in the suitcase and departed on a road trip from my home near Puget Sound to Long Beach, California and back. The setup and use was easy and the instructions were simple, well thought out, and well composed. The sound and picture were the best one could expect. Performance far exceeded the slim pickings on the hotel TVs. All isn't perfect, but maybe it's not Roku's fault. Somebody \"improved\" the YouTube app so it can no longer play the subscribed videos in most-recent-first order, which was for me the best way to watch the news, but Roku appears to have changed the same time other vendors changed, indicating some malevolent god somewhere sabotaging YouTube apps on Roku and all TVs simultaneously. Also, the HDMI connector design seems more difficult to use than any other, a trait that affects all HDMI everywhere, not just Roku. But if Roku could modify their male HDMI to slide easily into any female HDMI connector, that would improve the product. Well worth the money for me.",
            "I am looking to get rid on my expensive cable provider, there was one channel I watch that didn't have an app that I could watch it on. I did some research an found out I could watch it on the Roku Streaming Stick 4K - HDR & Dolby Vision Roku Streaming Device for TV with Voice Remote & Long-Range Wi-Fi. I purchased it, a few days later it was delivered and my son who is much more tech savvy than I am installed it on my TV. I found the channel I wanted on the Roku streaming device and am very happy, I can now cancel my cable provider. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and will purchase 2 more for my other TV's."

            "Big fan of these AirPods. The last generation I had was the AirPods Pro, the kind with the funny foam tip on them. I was not a big fan of the fit, I felt like they were always loose. I used different foam tips to try to address the issue of grip, but nonetheless, I never found success. For many years, I transitioned to Beats by Dre and used them for working out and outdoor activities. Despite the noticeable decrease in sound quality, I was never left wondering if they were securely attached to my ears. Fast-forward a couple years, the AirPods 4 come out and I decided to give them a go again because they are reminiscent of the original Apple headphones that I got when I got my first Apple iPod many moons ago. I am very, very happy and satisfied with them. They fit perfectly in my ears, just light enough to feel them, but not so light as to forget they‚Äôre there. No motion, wiggle, or play in the fit ‚Äì they feel very secure when I‚Äôm working out. Even when I sweat, they don‚Äôt slip out, and that was a big selling point for me.\nThe multiple sound loads are interesting. Obviously noise cancellation is very nice, the transparency allows. A little bit of background sound through, but not so much that it overwhelms the music, and adaptive adjust based on your environment. There‚Äôs also another feature that allows the music to turn down automatically when you‚Äôre speaking to someone That‚Äôs nice unless you plan on singing along at all as it will lower the music so that you can hear your own voice, lol\n\nThey charge wirelessly with ease, even with a protective case on the outside it still utilizes magnets to secure it section to the charger. The case seems very durable nice magnetic closure snaps open, snap shut very tight tolerances. The case can charge the headphones multiple times over, I have never had the headphones die, or the case die at the same time.",
            "I am overwhelmingly impressed by the quality of audio and aesthetics that this refurbished product brought. For many years I have used Samsung devices, which include their specific range of earbuds. This year I made the transition and purchased an iPad, I bought the essentialism the case, screen protectors, and now the AirPods 4. Because I bought the 2025 iPad new, and further bought warranty extension for it, I revisited my budget and decided to purchase, [weighting the risks], this set of earbuds in a refurbished like-new condition.\nOther than the packaging having a LPN label, I see no difference that other common new products have, the packaging is slightly scratched, but the interior and product itself, looks, feels, and performs brand new. To my surprise, and humble enjoyment, I recommend this product.",
            "I‚Äôm def a real review twin‚Ä¶ At first I had my doubts for these AirPods and would keep watching videos describing them as the best out of all the other AirPods so I took the chance and bought them. Turns out they are as great as they say so far the bass, sound quality, and looks are just the start of these brilliant little mfs. The greatest of all within these ear buds has to be the ANC, I work in a factory/warehouse and there are a lot of loud forklifts that ride around all day that with my last ear buds I had to turn the volume all the way up to just be able to hear my music. These are the total opposite you can turn the volume all the way down which the ANC on and have a forklift ride around all day and not hear it at all.(don‚Äôt wear them while working you won‚Äôt be able to hear anything coming unless you have transparency mode on) The 360 sound is another one of the best things these AirPods bestow which has scared me a couple times having me think people were behind me speaking. ( There wasn‚Äôt it was just the sound being so good it sound like someone was behind me speaking) if you were having doubts about these AirPods this review should help you. ( go ahead and get them gang you will thank me later)",
            "I recently upgraded to the Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds, and they‚Äôve exceeded every expectation. Here‚Äôs what I love:\n\nStellar Active Noise Cancellation: Blocks out distractions seamlessly‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm on a busy train or in a noisy caf√©.\n\nAdaptive Audio & Spatial Sound: Automatically tailors the soundstage to my surroundings, and the personalized spatial audio really makes music and movies feel immersive.\n\nAll-Day Comfort: The ergonomic design and lightweight fit mean I can wear them for hours without any discomfort or ear fatigue.\n\nH2 Chip Performance: Instant pairing, rock-solid Bluetooth connectivity, and ultra-low latency‚Äîperfect for calls, gaming, or streaming.\n\nConvenient Charging Options: The USB-C case charges wirelessly or via cable, and holds multiple top-ups so I‚Äôm never scrambling for a charger.\n\nRoom for Improvement:\nA bit more battery life per charge would be fantastic, but the fast-charge feature in the case already helps bridge the gap.\n\nOverall, the AirPods 4 deliver Apple‚Äôs signature blend of premium sound, intuitive features, and unbeatable comfort. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for headphones that just work‚Äîflawlessly."

            "This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.\n\nI'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.\n\nAfter doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.\n\nWhen I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)\n\nFor the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.\n\nI also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.\n\nAnd speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.\n\nAs a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.\n\nThe pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source. There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.\n\nI can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",
            "Might be important to give context to this opinion: I am an audio engineer. I've used many kind of headphones within large ranges of budgets. I know what good sound is.\n\nAs the title says, I don't think you can get something that beats these at the same price. These punch way above their weight.\n\nTheir sound is punchy and have great balance across the spectrum. No harshness in the high frequencies, a mid range with great separation that doesn't sound cluttered and instead is very clean, and very decent low end (bass) that compliments the rest of the spectrum.\n\nSome people are getting used to overpowering bass of some products and while I understand the appeal of actually feeling the rumble in your ears, I will take deep, clean, balanced bass over that any day of the week.\n\nThe battery is phenomenal. I use these everyday and probably charge them every 4 days or so. The led of charged status can be misleading, so I just leave them plugged to the wall for 3-4 hours. Enough to get 3-4 days of usage.\n\nThe app is useful. Has some cool features.\n\nOverall, a purchase that after 3 months of use, I would definitely recommend.\n\nGreat job by JBL. They have earned good reputation for a good reason.",
            "So I will start by saying I am no audiophike, so keep that in mind when you read my thoughts on this.\n\nMy previous earbuds were the Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless earbuds. I used those pretty much almost daily for 4 years, which means I became accustomed to that sound profile. In the end the right earbud gave out and it was time for a replacement, which landed me here (after watching 2-3 hours of YouTube reviews).\n\nThese things are equipped with way more pros than cons.\n1. The JBL Vibes connect to my phones Bluetooth much faster (I have a Google Pixel 8 Pro)\n2. They fit my ears better, whereas my old ones would fall out of my ears while I was chewing or leaning over. If I forced them in deeper the sound disappeared. It was a not so fun game of \"stay put\".\n3. The app for the JBL Vibes is easier to use and actually connects to your earbuds without a lot of jumping through hoops.\n4. The case is more compact so it's not so bulky in your pocket.\n\nSo I'll start by saying my 4 star rating is a conflicted one. For the price these things are a solid 5/5, but as an overall I would give these more of a 4.3 out 5.\n\nWhen you first pair them and start using them you might immediately know why the app exists, it's to take advantage of the equalizer. To my ears they sounded tin-y and scratchy with the highs and mids coming in way too hard ( S sounds were so sharp it made music sound harsh and not enjoyable).\nSo I opened up the Equalizer and put on some music from YouTube, selected the Jazz sound profile as my starting point then tweaked to what sounded good to me (see my attached screenshot). The other issue is, I can't blast these at full volume, they get uncomfortably loud, and the sound starts to distort, so I keep them just short of full blast and they sound great that way. There is a setting in the app to reduce the volume at max, but it's lower than I want it to be so I do not use that. The big key thing to do is get good clean bass out of the sound profile so you aren't listening to ear piercing highs.\n\nSo now that I got the sound out of the way and like what I'm hearing, my next issue is that these are not the most comfortable. Don't get me wrong, they aren't so uncomfortable that I would return them, but there is slight discomfort at the top of my ear canal, where the hard plastic pushes against my cartilage.\n\nThe battery life is pretty good and they charge quickly inside their case, which stays shut pretty well (I did a drop test onto carpeted floor and it stayed shut). My other one gripe at the moment is that putting the earbuds into the case in the dark is kind of tricky (say you are listening to music or a video while your SO is sleeping next to you, and now you want to go to sleep too, but it's dark). I find myself rotating the buds trying to position that lower piece back into the case at just the right angle.\n\nWould I recommend these to a friend just looking for a good reasonably priced option for earbuds? Yes, absolutely....would an audiophile agree with me, who knows.",

            "I use this product with an iPhone 15 Pro Max and Apple Music. I am of the opinion Apple is better for sound quality but I will leave it at that. These headphones were purchased to replace my beloved Sony Bluetooth headphones which died after eight years. I couldn‚Äôt justify the price of another pair of Sony headphones so I purchased these over Amazon day for $50. To me JBL is a cheaper version of Bose or something higher end. They do have decent sound quality but it depends how they are used. For example they come with three different ear sizes in the rubber fittings they come with. I use the smallest ones. I use these mostly at home. I‚Äôve tried them on a walk and totally prefer my cheap wired Apple headphones so one, I don‚Äôt lose them and two the little stems that connect to the power klack against my wooden spacers I wear in my ear. The Apple ones don‚Äôt which is funny. And the JBl do not totally block out sound like my Sony ones did. I usually wear one headphone in my right ear so I can hear my kids and pets at home but still listen to my tunes. I have hearing damage from playing in a band in both my ears but my right ear can take the JBl‚Äôs comfort wise. The bass response or rich tone is based on how the rubber fitting sits in your ear. So if you move around a lot for exercise or work not good for you. They come with an app you can download for free. You can tweak the sound with an EQ. The ten band is fine if you have an ear for mixing. Pick some good music you like and usually listen to. Then play with the EQ to find a sound you like. The pre-sets are ok but not that good. If the headphone is in mono like I use them they will then cut the EQ in the app that runs on yr phone and go to your Apple settings. I just use ‚ÄúRock‚Äù on my iPhone. And they sound great for what they are. I wouldn‚Äôt use these while driving a car. Or use them for talking on the phone jobs. I have seen many ppl complain they are hard to take out of the case. No more then other brands/types like these. Each bud fits either in the left or right side so you know which is which. The L and R indicators on the stems of the buds is very small. Maybe some other brands or types are different. We have Skull Candy and Google Pixel buds in the house and they are similar and different too so shop around before you buy. And the battery in these are decent. I listen to several hours of music a day sometimes. I do recommend taking them out and giving your hearing a break for ear fatigue. Believe me, if I‚Äôve been listening to my headphones for awhile I‚Äôll be able to tell while driving later as the radio will have to be turned down and that‚Äôs no fun when a good song comes on the radio is it! Great headphones for $50 and exactly what I wanted to buy.",

            "I recently purchased the Cloud Nest in-ear headphones, and I‚Äôm blown away by their performance. Simply amazing! For such an inexpensive pair, the dynamic range is incredible, delivering crisp highs and deep, rich lows. The bass response is particularly uncanny‚Äîpowerful yet balanced, making every track feel immersive.\n\nI was initially just looking for a cheap pair of workout headphones, but the Cloud Nest far exceeds expectations. There‚Äôs nothing cheap-sounding about these; they punch well above their price point. Comfortable for long sessions and perfect for everything from gym playlists to casual listening, they‚Äôre a steal.\n\nMoney well spent, and I‚Äôd highly recommend the Cloud Nest to anyone seeking quality audio on a budget.",
            "Go get yourself a pair or two or even three. For the price, these destroy any other name brand company out of the water. I purchased these because they were cheap and I just wanted to test them out. I am blown away by the bass and the quality. They sit pretty nice in my ears after changing the tip. I have yet to test out the battery life, but for 6 bucks, if they last 4 hours then I'll be happy.",
            "One time,... at the dollar store, I bought some wired earbuds for my phone. They were the worst.\n\nAnd then there's this... Wireless Earbuds for $5.99. I impulse bought it. As impulse purchases go, this is a pretty good deal (and my first pair of earbuds)!\n\nThings I noticed:\n\nMusic playback : The bass is strong. mids and highs good. It's the kind of sound quality I'd expect from wired headsets in the $20-$30 range).\n\nVoice quality: Clear and crisp although the built-in voice prompts sound muddy\n\nControls: Volume was easy enough to learn but I haven't gotten the hang of the other controls yet.\n\nCharge case: I guess a battery is built into the charge case. So you have to charge the case before the buds will charge.\n\nEarbuds: Snug fit and comfortable!\n\nOverall, kinda surprised at such a good deal!",
            "Only leave reviews if item stinks or is good, for value this product (so far) is great.\n\nPRO: cheap af, sound is passable, easy pairing, cool charging numbers display, low charge warning (can be annoying though), cheap af, so far so good in durability, good fitting, not too bulky.\n\nCON: case feels really cheap (it‚Äôs really cheap), doesn‚Äôt give notifications like texts of iOS this can be a feature since it also doesn‚Äôt annoy me with constant interruptions\n\nPRO/CON: native voice operator sounds like sega genesis quality",
            "Absolutely terrible. DO. NOT. BOTHER. Couple issues. One is the fit. Probably the most uncomfortable buds I've tried and CONSTANTLY falling out. I was willing to assume this is just my ear shape, so maybe this would work ok for someone else. The thing that makes these EVIL is the way they did the volume control. Namely, good luck ever being able to adjust the volume on purpose. However, you'll go to push them into your ear, and somehow this triggers the \"max volume\" setting. With zero way to get it to stop without taking them out of your ear. Then you put them back and it triggers it again. It seems like the skin on the ear is all it takes to trigger that. Nothing like suddenly having it blare noise so loud you think your ear drums will pop and no matter how many times you try to swipe the volume down it just keeps screaming \"max volume\" in your ear. Designed by someone that hates their customers, or intentionally bad so you eventually purchase a more expensive pair. Even trying to keep the price down, there is no reason to make the volume controls this useless.",
            "The ear buds work but the warranty takes you to a Chinese website that says setting up...never loads so that was a red flag in my head!",
            "I don't like to spend a lot on earbuds so at 6.99, this is a steal simply because the bass is decent. They feel comfortable to wear and when I used just 1 earbud it did not convert it to mono. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase and felt that the earbuds are good value for the money. This will be my go-to earbuds now!",
            "Great purchase! I used these for work, and they are clear, vibrant sound, not the static that you hear in alot of them. Fast charging & long lasting. I also use them while cutting grass & they are great to drown out the noise from the mower. Will buy again",
            "Resistentes, solo al inicio se batalla para conectarse, pero despu√©s todo marcha bien."

            "Lordy lord. This mount is it. It says 99lbs Limit, but I extended it and did a pull up on it. Now I wouldn't Advise that. I did it for my own peace of mind after torquing it to the wall. I weight just about 185-190. I was very surprised with it being rock solid. The TV we got only weighed about 30lbs, but the wife wanted something that was gone be capable in case we later upgraded to a larger model of Tv. I can say this mount is wonderful. It fit our 55\" perfect with no issues. Love the Flexibility it offered especially the ease of assembly. The Instructions were a little confusing, but we ended up figuring it out without'em. If ya want stronk! Then this mounts for you! I will say its a little more expensive then most mounts. But it makes up for it with the versatility.",
            "Incredible, built as strong as they come , extremely easy install and holds my Sony Bravia 65 inch like it's a feather ! I did not use the bolts that came with this , instead, I used SPAX Lag screws of 3 inches directly into the center of the studs , much easier and just as strong if not stronger ! Just make sure your level up and across !! Installed in about 3 minutes! Love the versatility of this mount also , swings in every direction! Anyway great buy and monster TV mount !",
            "Very sturdy, but this thing is hard to put up üò≠ I will also say if your studs are 24 inches apart instead of 16 inches you won‚Äôt be able to use 2 studs on each end as the back of this is made for studs that are 16 inches apart. I didn‚Äôt have time to return and replace but since my tv is pretty light we just centered the mount on a stud and reinforced the edges with regular screws. It seems really stable to I‚Äôm satisfied.",
            "TV mount is easy to install. Be sure to hit a stud. It is sturdy and holds my 55\" TV for the porch. I like this style becaue I can pull out the TV from the wall and then tilt it towards the outdoor patio area. When done, I can push back against the wall.",
            "Make sure to check whether your HDMI port access is blocked by the mount before you finish installing. I am happy with how sturdy the mount is, but I am very disappointed that I can‚Äôt use more than one HDMI port on my TV right now (possibly I can take it all down, feed the cable through a hole in the mount and then reinstall, but that will be difficult for me without help.)",

            "Great product. It was easy to assemble with step by step instructions and all hardware included. We recommend this tv mount if you have a position that requires tilting and swivel.",

Came packaged well, instuctions easy to understand, comes with everything you need except the tools (tools supplied by you) Holds my 65 inch very nicely. I recommend this if your looking for a wall mount for you tv. Read the details of it to see if you can use this size as it's not for a 20 in tv.",
            "I am really pleased with this mounting kit and highly recommend it to anyone needing one for a 26-55\" TV wall Mount.\nThere are a few different kits available depending on the Wall Stud Distance and one or two arm mounts. I choose the two arm mount 16\" Spacing kit.\nLike always shipping was free and really fast to my small remote town via Canada Post. Very pleased how fast it came.\nIt was nicely packaged and when opening it, I found everything nicely labeled and packaged nicely. The instructions with the kit were really well done I feel, and easy to follow.\nSome of the Bonus Features I found were:\n1) Included a really nice HDMI Cable\n2) Includes Not Only a Wall Template but a small Bubble Level to connect to the wall template, but also a larger level for other leveling needs.\n3)Contains handy velcro straps for cable mounting.\n\nMounting the wall mount was pretty simple, I found where the studs were on the wall and marked them with a pencil, I then found the right position for my mount using my markings and the included template. It includes a small level you mount to the template and this allows you to get it nice and straight. I then predrilled the mount holes and removed the template.\n\nI was painting the wall, so did found the locations and predrilled holes before doing drywall repairs/painting, just in case.\n\nWhen the time came to mount the wall mount, I used the included lag bolts and put them into the wall studs I pre drilled earlier.\nYou use the included larger level to get your wall mount just right and then tighten in the bolts.\n\nThe kit comes with a good selection of bolts, spacers and washers to mount the mounting pieces to your actual TV. I found I needed longer bolts, but the spacers etc worked perfect.\nJust lift the TV up now and attach it onto the wall mount. Once on, tighten the lock screws and its on there good.\nYou can then make the adjustments like tilt and any fine tune straightening.\n\nI really like how well this kits is made, and all the included things to make installation as simple as it could possibly be.\nBeing able to pull the TV Away from the Wall and move at angles if we are out on the back deck is really handy and moves smooth.\n\nI would highly recommend this kit to anyone needing one, it really made installing my first TV wall mount a breeze and I feel comfortable with my TV hanging on it.",

            "I've only ever owned Android phones and Windows PCs. I have a Windows gaming laptop and a Windows desktop at home. I bought Pixel Bud Pros instead of Airpod Pros, and I plan to buy either a Samsung or a Pixel smartwatch instead of an Apple Watch. But as for tablets, I avoid Android and Windows like the plague. So I picked this iPad up on sale, and I've never once regretted it. It's a solid, fast tablet, even though it's using the older A16 chip from the iPhone 14 lineup. Reading eBooks, ordering lunch, doomscrolling, playing games, obviously it can do them all. Battery life is stellar and it even comes with a charging brick in the box with cable. Whatever bad decisions Apple have been making with their phones, they've avoided a lot of them with their iPads, and that's why I would recommend one to anyone. Maybe go with the 256 GB model though, I've found myself limited by what games I can install on the 128 GB model.",
            "The Apple 11-inch iPad with an A16 chip, Wi-Fi connectivity, and 128GB of storage is a powerful and versatile tablet that appeals to both casual users and professionals. It's super light weight & perfect for traveling or on the go.\n\nI‚Äôve been using this iPad for a few weeks now & I‚Äôm really so impressed. I bought the blue which is so pretty likewise the other color choices. It‚Äôs super fast‚Äîapps open instantly & everything runs smoothly. The screen looks amazing with bright and vibrant colors, & its perfect for watching shows or editing photos. Bought a pen which works perfectly with it also.\n\nThe battery lasts all day without a problem, even with heavy use whether its working, studying, streaming or gaming.\n\nIf you‚Äôre thinking about getting a ipad, it's a great choice. I totally recommend it. Worth every dollar. Would recommend over & over again.",
            "Several years ago, I purchased the 10.9-inch Apple iPad, and like its predecessors, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. As someone who has worked with a variety of laptops, desktops, tablets, iPads, and Macs over the past two decades, I have found this device to be an excellent choice for personal use. I opted for what I consider the most comfortable and adaptable option, albeit one of the more expensive models. Given my limited use of the iPhone, I conduct approximately 95% of my internet browsing, social media interactions, emails, and research on my new 11-inch Apple A16 iPad from 2025.\n\nThe size difference between the two models is negligible, yet I have enhanced my experience by pairing the iPad with an affordable keyboard that transforms it into a more efficient typing device, as I find the on-screen keyboard quite unsatisfactory. As a baby boomer at 63 years old, I appreciate the convenience of being able to use the iPad to make phone calls and send texts to my contacts, allowing for seamless communication. Additionally, I can easily stay in touch with my grandchildren who live out of state.\n\nI have consolidated my four email accounts‚ÄîYahoo, Gmail, iCloud, and AOL‚Äîinto a single app, streamlining my communication. I can also set up various applications, including online college courses, without any issues. Although this purchase was a significant expense after just a few years‚Äîapproximately four, if I recall correctly‚Äîthe daily usage justifies the investment.\n\nThe snap-in keyboard is adjustable to various angles, remains stable, and adds minimal weight to the iPad. Its dual function as a cover provides excellent protection against drops from considerable heights, which I find to be a significant advantage. The color of the iPad and the keyboard/cover complement each other beautifully; the blue hue of the iPad is particularly aesthetically pleasing, especially for those who favor that color.\n\nI appreciate the upgrades and was pleased to find that transferring data from my old iPad to the new one took less than ten minutes. After organizing some personal settings‚Äîsuch as disabling Siri, which I do not prefer‚Äîupdating apps, and making cosmetic adjustments like resizing icons on the home screen and cleaning up photos, I felt satisfied with my decision to upgrade.\n\nI chose to make this transition during a period of downtime in my life, and while the process was neither challenging nor time-consuming, I am eager to explore new features. As I navigate my chemotherapy treatment, I find myself with ample time to utilize this device effectively. While the physical size difference is minimal, the improved typing speed, increased storage capacity, and overall experience have made me grateful for this upgrade. I highly recommend this Apple iPad and the specific model I have selected to meet my needs.***the color of his iPad is a pearlized cornflower or sky blue. It is quite beautiful and my phones camera did not do it justice i these photo‚Äôs. The color they show you on the webpage is much closer to the real color but until you see it in person, you can‚Äôt even imagine how lovely it is.",
            "This iPad is so fast, I half expect it to brew my morning coffee before I even tap the screen. The A16 chip handles everything from streaming to multitasking with the grace of a ballet dancer and the speed of a cheetah on espresso.\n\nThe 11-inch Liquid Retina display is a visual treat‚Äîcolors pop like confetti at a New Year‚Äôs party, and the clarity makes me question if I‚Äôve been watching videos in standard definition my whole life. Ôøº\n\nBattery life? All-day, as promised. I binge-watched an entire season of my favorite show, took notes, doodled questionable art, and still had juice left to scroll through memes before bed. Ôøº\n\nTouch ID is snappy and reliable, making me feel like a secret agent every time I unlock it. And the Wi-Fi 6 ensures my connection is as stable as my obsession with this device. Ôøº\n\nIn short, this iPad doesn‚Äôt just meet expectations‚Äîit surpasses them with a wink and a smile. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their tech game. Ôøº",
            "The laptop my mom gave me is actually about 15 years old! I didn‚Äôt know until I had to search for a new battery for it (last year) and the battery I bought was probably only a few months old and it‚Äôs already telling me that the battery is low plus my laptop I gave to my stepfather (because it stopped working) like 4 years ago and he still hasn‚Äôt given it back to me so lol‚Ä¶ just like that I bought my FIRST ever iPad.\nIt‚Äôs beautiful! The package was secured, no damages, no issues so far.\nMy guardian angels gave me the green light to buy it and I have no regrets!\n\nAlso in case you guys are wondering, the iPad DOESN‚ÄôT come with a pen and keyboard. I bought those separately."

            "This is so easy to setup and use, I wish I got this years ago. I'll be honest, and I feel a bit foolish admitting this, but: Despite hearing about the Fire TV stick's existence for years, I never considered it because I thought there was a monthly fee! I didn't want to pay for anything beyond my subscriptions, so I never even read the details. I put my television in a box in the attic when I 'cut the cord' with my cable company in 2012 and it's been there ever since. I've been watching 'TV' on my desktop PC or on my Kindle.\n\nThis worked well enough for years, but during the pandemic I began spending a lot more time streaming shows and despite replacing my desk chair with a more comfortable chair, it just wasn't ergonomic and became more and more uncomfortable, so I needed to reconsider my TV setup. Enter the Fire Stick! This time I read the details - and then re-read them, and then Youtubed videos about it, because I couldn't believe it really didn't cost anything per month! You just buy the stick and plug it in and that's it?! Yep!\n\nSo here's a few noteworthy points: First, it does not use USB; I saw this pop up in the questions for this product quite a bit. Technically the wall adapter plugs into the included USB cord - just like your kindle charger, etc. But there's no USB needed for the actual television end, it uses an HDMI port and that's it. Interestingly, I almost didn't get it because I was sure the TV I bought back in 2009 wouldn't have an HDMI port, but I finally went up to the attic to check and sure enough, it has one! So be sure your TV has an HDMI port, that's required.\n\nSetup was ridiculously easy. Just attach the items in the box together and plug it into the HDMI port on the back of your TV and then plug the other end into a wall outlet. That's it! Then turn the TV on and the setup will walk you through the rest, signing you into your Amazon account, calibrating the included remote control, updating (several times), choosing streaming apps to start with, etc. It's all very simple.\n\nIf you want to watch paid streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, etc you must have a paid subscription to them. But there's other services/apps such as Pluto TV and others that are totally free and have a decent variety of ad-supported content, both shows and movies as well as news. And Amazon's apps are of course there, like Amazon Music and Prime Video (if you subscribe to Prime Video). I only have Hulu and Prime Video currently as paid subscriptions, but there's plenty of free content to supplement. In fact, I even have my local news which surprised me (they must stream on a live app and I never realized it).\n\nSo basically, it aggregates various paid and free streaming apps to one place and this little stick presents them all in one nice looking interface, letting you use your remote to choose programming, just like TV. To be clear, the Fire TV stick runs off your wifi signal, so be sure you have wifi at home. On one hand it doesn't give you anything you can't get without it, but on the other hand, the convenience of having it all accessible in one place is fantastic and makes it feel like I'm getting all kinds of new content. Some of the apps I've never even heard of, so there is new-to-me content in that regard.\n\nThe interface is excellent and fairly intuitive, and the remote works great. I am super glad I opted for the Fire TV stick option that comes with the remote that also has TV controls like volume and mute, so I can do it all with the remote that came with it. Now I can sit in my living room like a normal person and watch TV (streaming services) comfortably from my couch; I should have got this years ago.\n\nJust be sure you have:\n\n1. A TV with an HDMI port\n2. Wifi at home\n3. OPTIONAL: Paid services if you want to watch Hulu, Netflix, etc. Otherwise you can still use this to access free content.",

            "Estoy s√∫per satisfecha con mi compra del Fire TV Stick.

            "I wasn‚Äôt sure I needed another Alexa device in my life, but I also wasn‚Äôt sure I needed a new coffee maker until I tried one, so here we are. The Amazon Echo Pop with Alexa has officially earned a permanent spot in my home‚Äîand I‚Äôm actually mad I didn‚Äôt get it sooner.\n\nFirst, the sound. I was shocked at how clear and surprisingly full the sound is for such a compact speaker. It doesn‚Äôt just play music, it fills the room without making me feel like I‚Äôm listening to a tin can. No, it‚Äôs not a full surround sound system, but for the size and price, it‚Äôs incredibly impressive.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about the looks. The Echo Pop has this sleek, minimalistic design that blends seamlessly into any room. It doesn‚Äôt look like some gadget that screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to take over your life,‚Äù but more like ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm here to help you with whatever you need, and I look adorable doing it.‚Äù\n\nAnd, of course, it‚Äôs Alexa. So, whether I‚Äôm asking for the weather, setting timers, or controlling the smart lights, Alexa responds quickly and reliably. It's like having a personal assistant who doesn't judge you for asking the same question 12 times (like when the UPS package will arrive).\n\nBut here‚Äôs where it gets fun: We‚Äôve set up a routine with Alexa that automatically plays music when the dogs start barking. It‚Äôs like Alexa becomes our \"bark interrupter\"‚Äîwe get a little peaceful music playing while the dogs realize the barking isn‚Äôt necessary. Honestly, it‚Äôs the best use of tech I never knew I needed. Plus, it‚Äôs a nice little bonus to get the tunes rolling during those random barking bursts.\n\nWhy I love it: ‚Ä¢ Great sound quality for the size‚Äîfills the room without being overwhelming. ‚Ä¢ Easy setup, like every Alexa device I‚Äôve ever had. Plug it in, connect, and you‚Äôre good to go. ‚Ä¢ A sleek, stylish design that actually fits into any space without being obtrusive. ‚Ä¢ Alexa! Need I say more? It‚Äôs like having a mini tech genie at your command. ‚Ä¢ And the best part: our barking routine. The music starts up when the dogs get too loud. Genius.\n\nVine Team, if you‚Äôre looking for reviewers who can talk about both smart tech and the fact that this little thing has a surprisingly fun personality‚Äîlook no further. I‚Äôve got dogs, music, and a soft spot for gadgets that actually work.",
            "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5 stars)\n\nI've been using the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) for a week or so now, and it has truly transformed my smart home experience. The design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into any room. The sound quality is impressive for a device of this size‚Äîrich bass, clear vocals, and a good volume range make it perfect for music, podcasts, or voice commands.\n\nThe Alexa voice assistant is highly responsive and versatile. I use it daily to set reminders, control smart home devices, ask for weather updates, and even get news briefings. The integration with other smart home products has been smooth, allowing me to control lights, thermostats, and locks effortlessly.\n\nSetup was straightforward via the Alexa app, and the device recognizes my voice commands quickly. The microphone array is excellent at picking up commands even from across the room, and the privacy features, like the microphone off button, provide peace of mind.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) to anyone looking to add a smart speaker to their home. It‚Äôs a great combination of functionality, design, and affordability.",
            "The Amazon Echo Pop is the perfect little smart speaker with a big personality! I got it to use in a smaller room, and it‚Äôs been fantastic. The sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for its size ‚Äî great for music, podcasts, and even voice responses from Alexa.\n\nSetup was super simple ‚Äî just a few taps in the Alexa app and it was ready to go. Alexa responds quickly and accurately, and it easily connects to smart devices around the house. I use it for timers, weather updates, smart lights, and more, all hands-free.\n\nThe design is sleek and compact, so it fits perfectly on a nightstand or shelf without taking up space. It adds a nice modern touch to the room and comes in fun colors too.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a small but mighty smart speaker for your home or office, the Echo Pop is a great choice. Affordable, functional, and fun ‚Äî highly recommend!",
            "I picked up the Echo Pop in Midnight Teal, and I‚Äôm honestly impressed with how much this little speaker can do. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit anywhere‚Äîmine‚Äôs on a small shelf in the kitchen‚Äîbut the sound quality is still crisp and clear, with surprisingly rich bass for the size.\n\nAlexa responds quickly, even with background noise, and it works great for everything from setting timers to streaming music or controlling smart devices. I also really like the color‚Äîit adds a nice pop (no pun intended!) to the room without being too flashy.\n\nSetup was fast, and the whole experience feels polished. Amazon clearly put a lot of thought into making this a great budget-friendly smart speaker.\n\nI‚Äôd love the chance to try and review more Amazon devices. I enjoy giving detailed, honest feedback, and the Echo Pop shows just how much Amazon keeps improving its tech‚Äîeven in the smallest packages."

            "I was terrified about hanging my 60inch tv simply because I have heard so many stories about folks television fall or bending off of their device. I was so nervous about hanging my television I bought a stand just in case I changed my mind and decided not to hang the television. A friend of mine recommended this device and has used this product for hangning 3 televisions in house and has told other friends to order this, courtesy of AMAZON. So I took his advice and ordered this as well. In fact that same friend came installed and actially hung my television for me. Glad that I did order. The flexibility and movement from where I have in my living room allows me to view anywhere comfortably from my living room. More than sturdy enough to hold my television.",
            "We‚Äôve got a big household (family of 7), so durability and ease of setup matter. I bought two of these Amazon Basics full motion wall mounts for a pair of 55\" TVs in the kids‚Äô rooms, and they‚Äôve worked out great. The build feels solid, and both installs were straightforward with no surprises.\n\nThe motion range is smooth and flexible‚Äîeasy to adjust for viewing angles, but firm enough to hold position without sagging. Mounting into studs was no problem, and the included hardware covered everything I needed.\n\n‚úÖ Holds 55\" screens with confidence\n‚úÖ Full articulation with tilt and swivel\n‚úÖ Clean, low-profile look when folded flat\n‚úÖ Great value for the quality\n‚úÖ Instructions were actually helpful\n\nWith multiple TVs and a busy home, I try to stick with products that are simple, reliable, and do what they promise. This one checked all the boxes‚Äîand I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more as we keep upgrading around the house.",
            "After mounting, my tv sits centered on the wall just as expected. Like other reviews mention, the instructions are not very clear so you might have to experiment a little bit it what works and what doesn‚Äôt. The lag screws provided did not fit my socket wrench, leaving me to do it by hand with the tool provided which is a little frustrating and time-consuming. I switched out the lag screws for ones that actually did fit due to that.",
            "These are overall a nice option for a monitor mount. I mainly chose these because I wanted something that was as close to the wall as possible (these are only ~0.7‚Äù from the wall to the thickest place on the mount) as well as being able to latch in place when you placed the monitor on the mount, which these do with a little pin and pull cord. They also came with four ‚Äòarms‚Äô, a variety of different screws for use with other monitors/tvs, and a wall mount template, but I didn‚Äôt end up needing any of that. I used them to mount two ViewSonic 24‚Äù monitors. The only downside for me (which likely won‚Äôt be an issue for most people) is that when you place the monitor on the wall mount, it is quite loose - there is a good bit of play in the sense that the edges of the monitor can move front/back and up/down, essentially being able to wobble around a bit. This could potentially be an issue for someone with a dual monitor setup, as you would have to get the wall mounted pieces installed perfectly so that the monitors would end up nicely lined up with eachother. It‚Äôs also an issue for me because I live in a ‚Äútiny house on wheels‚Äù (kind of like a camper/fifth wheel) so I didn‚Äôt want the monitors to be able to wobble around that much when we tow the home on the road. Luckily, I was able to make a few modifications and now the monitors sit quite snugly on the mounts and are barely able to move at all - I added a thin foam strip at the top of the piece attached to the back of the monitor, and a piece of duct tape to the bottom of that piece. I also added some blocks with foam strips to sit between the wall and the back sides of the monitors.",
            "This is a well designed and well built TV wall mount. Although, in my opinion the directions could be clearer, that doesn't take away from how impressed I am with the product. It comes with everything you need for a successful installation including all mounting supplies and extras that you might find useful at a later date. Once mounted, the TV can be tilted and adjusted in so many ways. It can easily be stored almost flat to the wall. I recommend this mount.",
            "I used this for a 40inch TCL tv and it worked like a charm. This is as easy as mounting a tv is gonna get. You can tilt the tv, angle it downward (if mounting high like I did) and the positions you can set the tv in are endless. If you need something for a tricky area, corner or something like that.. this does the job. It also can be used if you‚Äôre setting the tv and don‚Äôt want to move it. Covers all bases. 2 bolts (provided) will support the piece that mounts on the wall. The distance between the 2 holes are 5 5/8 inches (on center). But since it‚Äôs too/bottom just find the stud and you‚Äôre good to go. I actually missed the stud on the top hole and used the provided anchor.. so with one bolt in the stud it‚Äôs holding my 40 inch tv with ease. Attached are some pics.. I needed this for a tricky area between closet opening and doorway. Also, this can be done by yourself. Once you mount the plate on the back of the tv, it sets in place on the mount..2 screws secure it in place. 2 people would be nice to be extra cautious but again, I did this myself taking my sweet old time and did it in 30min.",
            "\"I'm blown away by how easy it was to install this wall mount! The instructions were clear, and the included hardware made the process a breeze. I was able to get it up on my wall in under 30 minutes, and it's been rock-solid ever since. The design is sleek and sturdy, and it looks great in my home. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a hassle-free mounting solution. Five stars!\"",
            "What can I say, it‚Äôs affordable, easy to install, AND it came with a small level tool! 10/10 would instantly buy again if I needed to mount another TV. S.O. loves being able to rotate the TV towards the kitchen!\n\nIncluded template made drilling holes in the right spot easy. Kit includes so many adapters for different tv types. Honestly can‚Äôt say enough good about this mount.\n\nTook me 45 minutes.",
            "Parece endeble pero no lo es, mi televisi√≥n de 32\" est√° perfecta colgada, eso si, va muy justo a la pared y si los cables son traseros puede darte un poco de guerra"

            "Imagine holding a thousand books in your hand. Imagine wearing your jammies while getting that next book in your series, and starting into it a minute later. Imagine reading at night in bed without needing a lamp because your book is backlit (and the light doesn‚Äôt hurt your eyes). Imagine having your kindle read to you (even if you don‚Äôt have audiobooks) with text to speech while you drive or fold laundry.\n\nThe 12th edition of the Kindle Paperwhite is a fabulous device and well-worth considering if you read a lot. It‚Äôs not too big, not heavy, waterproof, and easy to carry in your purse or backpack. Note that if you get a cover with it (highly recommended), when you open the cover the Kindle turns on automatically to the last page you were reading. With the cover open it feels like you‚Äôre holding a thin book -- or fold back the cover if you prefer.\n\nThe Kindle E-reader is not a computer. It‚Äôs not a tablet or a phone. It is a gizmo that acts like a book with a black-and-white flat e-ink screen showing typed sentences and paragraphs. You turn pages one at a time, just like a book. There is no movement on the page and no distraction or advertisement*. It is just text, plus any images that the author has included to illustrate his book.\n\n*NOTE: The advertisements on the Kindle are on the main page not the individual book pages and just show books you might like. They are unobtrusive.\n\nThe backlighting, unlike a computer, tablet, or phone, is gentle because the Kindle‚Äôs light is directed onto the screen, not into your eyes. You can change lighting level and add warmth (yellow lighting), decide on dark screen or light screen, and change the size of the print to make your reading experience ‚Äújust the way you like it.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs super-simple to access your own ebooks or to find new ones either on your computer or directly on the Kindle. They load in less than a minute onto the Kindle, ready for reading. Keep in mind if you are a reader that ebooks tend to be half or less the price of the same books in print. You can even find FREE ebooks and audiobooks on Amazon and/or use the Libby app (libbyapp.com) to borrow LOCAL LIBRARY books. You may want to consider subscribing to Kindle Unlimited for $12/month so you can download an even wider selection of free ebooks, audiobooks, and magazines from Amazon to keep as long as you want.\n\nCan you tell I love my Kindle? I am wowed by having so many books so easily accessible ‚Äî not like the time I took that 5-hour flight with one crummy poorly written book and nothing else to do. This 12th generation Kindle is fantastic. The battery lasts a long time. The screen is plenty sensitive for page turns and navigation. I go through one or two books a week easy with this little device.\n\nEbooks have revolutionized the publishing industry, and if you are a reader, the Kindle may be exactly what you‚Äôre looking for. If you read many ebooks on your phone or a tablet, consider being kind to your eyes with a Kindle. If you are resisting because you aren‚Äôt sure you‚Äôll like ebooks as well as print books, I say what the heck, the Kindle may be worth a try. It‚Äôs like driving a racing car rather than a horse and buggy. You might decide you love it.\n\n*\n\nNOTE: To enable TTS (text to speech) so that your kindle can read to you without audiobooks, turn on your wireless headphones or speaker. Then on your Kindle, tap the top of the screen, then hit the three dots on the right. Go to Settings. Hit Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, then Bluetooth Devices. Select your device so your Kindle will recognize it.\n\nNext, close the window and go back to Settings. Hit Accessibility, then turn on Voiceview screen reader. The Kindle should start talking to you. If it‚Äôs glitchy, just turn off your bluetooth device then turn it on again. Remember that you have to give double taps not single taps on the Kindle to navigate actions. If you want to change the volume or reading speed (I like 1.25x) just double tap on Voiceview screen to show and customize your settings.",
            "I received my Kindle PW (Paper White) 2024 yesterday!\n\nMy Kindle History Up to Current:\nI was using the previous PW which I loved until losing it on a flight - so I dusted off my 2018 PW, popped on a new case and have been using it again for the past 2 years again.\nInitially I was holding out for the Colorsoft version. However, when it finally came out the reviews were mediocre to poor. The clincher against my buying the Colorsoft was reading that even in B&W mode, the resolution wasn't as crisp as the standard Kindle PW products. So given the choice between mediocre resolution + mediocre color vs excellent B&W I opted for the 2024 PW.\nFrom reading reviews on it across the spectrum here, I admit I had the return already prepared.\nHowever, my unit arrived in beautiful condition.\n\nColor:\nThe chief thing I was looking for was the complaint regarding predominantly yellow screen with the bottom ‚Äòyellower‚Äô band. Not sure if these were faults with the earlier units.\nOn mine, if I have warmth at 0 and the brightness turned up, the color while not being cool, is about as neutral as possible against physical paper. Dimming to 0 relying on ambient light exaggerates the warmth on the Kindle device especially in my place which uses 2700K warm white light sources.\nThe uniformity on the page is perfect - I have not been able to create the darker color band on the lower screen that several reviewers have reported.\nI haven't yet taken it out into sunlight. I still find the page color at all spectrums is well within my comfort for reading as with paper books where there are also many variations of white color on the pages under different light sources.\n\nResolution:\nBefore ordering I researched the difference between eink and eink carta as my 2018 PW also has 300 ppi. I can't say there is a noticeable difference in the clarity between the 2018 and 2024 unless I look at it under magnifying glass side by side. The difference is nowhere near as detectable as when I upgraded from my 1st gen Kindle to the 2018 PW. In any case both are acceptable and the 2024 resolution is crisp and beautiful as I expected.\nEDIT: I finally used this at night in the dark with the brightness set at 8.\nDuring the day, the resolution to my naked eye looked about the same as my 2018 PW.\nAt night though, the 2024 PW looks far neater and crisper than the older model, even though both are 300 points (the eink Carta difference at work)\n\nPerformance:\nThis area is where I could really feel the upgrade.\nI had no complaints on reading the 2018, but starting, inputting my pin or typing anything in the search area, there was noticeable lag that I was accustomed to since using my first Kindle device.\nThe 2024 has almost no latency; if it does I have a hard time noticing it. Whether keying in my PIN or typing a search, it is now as instantly responsive as typing on my phone or tablet.\nThe page turning is as crisp as advertised, and I‚Äôm enjoying the animation.\n\nSize, Weight, Etc .\nForm Factor - I'm still in love!\nSize - I loved the compact size of the 2018 - almost same as small paperback. While the 2024 is a hair larger, I know I'll acclimate with no problem. It's now about the same as a larger paperback - but much lighter in most cases. I also use it with the Cobak Jade color case - while I love the minimalism of the naked Kindle device, having the stand for me is a must rather than having to hold it. Of course, I remove the case when I want to use it in the hot tub.\n\nPower Button Location\nJury is still out on this.\nI really wish they'd move the power button to the top. On all the Kindles I have owned over the years, I'm annoyed when I hold the unit (even with the case) my finger tends to brush the power button putting the unit to sleep while I'm reading!\nOn this 2024 PW, I'm noticing that with the increased width and offset position of the button, this may be enough for me to avoid the problem as I typically hold the unit on the bottom dead center, so I'll reserve judgement until I have used the product more.\n\nOverall, while I could have used my 2018 a few more years, the improvements in the 2024 made upgrading completely worthwhile."

            "I‚Äôve been using Echo devices since they first came out in 2014, and I just picked up the new 2025 Echo Spot to replace a Sphere-style Echo Spot I had in my bedroom. This new model has a taller form factor and features a 2.83‚Äù touchscreen (240x320 resolution), which is both a nice upgrade and a potential concern.\n\nSetup was mostly smooth‚ÄîI opted into the pre-configuration option when I ordered it, so it automatically connected to my Wi-Fi. That part worked well, but it did take almost two full minutes to scan for networks, which felt longer than it should. After connecting, it went through about 12 minutes of firmware updates and restarted twice before it was ready to use. Not awful, but not instant either.\n\nThe touchscreen is helpful for checking time, weather, or tapping quick actions. While it can be turned off in the settings, I prefer to leave it on‚Äîso I‚Äôm a bit concerned about potential screen burn-in over time. Previous models like the Echo Dot with clock used simple LED displays that didn‚Äôt have this issue.\n\nPerformance-wise, the touchscreen feels sluggish. Navigation and responsiveness are noticeably slow, and it seems underpowered out of the box. For the price I paid, it‚Äôs about what I expected, but I do worry that firmware updates over time will make it even slower. It already feels like it‚Äôs just barely keeping up.\n\nSound quality is solid‚Äîon par with past Echo models. Maybe even better! I think the bass sounds better? Perhaps there‚Äôs an improved subwoofer. It‚Äôs clear and loud enough for a bedroom or small room. My biggest frustration is the physical button placement. The volume and mic mute buttons are tucked onto the upper back of the device, which makes them nearly impossible to access if you keep the unit pushed into a corner (like on a nightstand against the wall). Every other Echo I‚Äôve owned had intuitive top-accessible buttons‚Äîthis feels like a design oversight.\n\nOn a positive note, the power adapter is still 15W and compatible with older Echo Spot models. I didn‚Äôt have to swap any cords while rearranging my devices, which made the transition easier.\n\nI‚Äôm also in the process of phasing out my aging Echo Plus units due to persistent subwoofer crackling. They were great initially, but the audio degraded‚Äîpossibly from firmware updates or hardware failure. I‚Äôve repurposed my older Spot to the bathroom for a basic clock display, and I‚Äôm rotating other devices accordingly.\n\nOverall, this new Spot does the job, but it‚Äôs not without its compromises. Setup requires patience, performance is underwhelming, and the design could‚Äôve been more thoughtful. Still, for now, it fits into my ecosystem.",
            "I traded in two older models on echo dots to get this and boy am I glad I did. The face sits so you can easy see it and you have several options of how you want to see the display. I love that I can see the time and temperature. The buttons on top are easier to find and use. The fact that you can see the alarm that is set for the furture and it was easy to set up since I had already had a Echo dot. I also love that it displays what you asked along with he title and singer for music. The music sound is perfect and clear. I got a discount and trade in value, bit it still was worth the cost to get. Very happy to have a beautiful blue Echo Spot and recommend everyone to trade up!",
            "We bought the Echo Dot Kids for my daughter around Christmas time, partly hoping it would help answer some of the wild questions she comes up with (and save me some head-scratching!). While it hasn't completely taken over that role, it primarily gets used for playing music and checking the weather, which it does really well. We particularly love that it conveniently shows the temperature right on the home screen.\n\nOn no fault of the product itself, I had initially thought we'd be able to use it for video calls while I was at work, but it's important to note that this particular model isn't capable of video chatting. Overall, it's a fun and useful little device for music and information for kids, as long as you're aware of its capabilities!",
            "Picked this up on a whim last week. Didn't really need it, but my original Echo, while still working, could not securely connect to my network. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER the MAC address for the unit was printed on the outside of the box!!! This allowed me to whitelist the MAC on my network before even powering it up. This saved me the hassle of going in and opening up my network so that it could connect so I could find the MAC, whitelisting it, rebooting my network and hoping everything else will reconnect immediately. That last bit is typically a rarity.\n\nAnyway, got it up and running. The setup through my phone is still a bit buggy and some things simply do not work.\n\nThe strangest thing is the color changes to the clock digits. During the day, they are white, but in the mid-afternoon they turn dark red as if going into night mode. Then, around one in the AM the display turns white again. I don't get it. I have night mode set from ten at night to seven in the morning, so why is it doing this weird thing? I've searched for answers to this question and posed the question on the forum here and it's crickets.\n\nIt works, with its quirkiness...so far.",
            "Okay, so I got the new Amazon Echo Spot, and I'm pretty happy with it! It's the perfect size for so many places. I've got mine on my nightstand, and it's great. It doesn't take up a ton of space, which is awesome. But I can totally see it working well in an office or even the kitchen.\n\nThe main thing is, it's a really good smart alarm clock. The display is clear, and I love that I can just ask Alexa to set an alarm. No more fumbling with tiny buttons in the dark! And of course, it does way more than just alarms.\n\nAlexa is super helpful, as always. I can ask about the weather, control my smart home devices, and even listen to music. The sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small device. It's clear, and it can get pretty loud if you want it to.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you're looking for a smart device that's compact, versatile, and has a good display, the new Echo Spot is definitely worth checking out. It's a solid upgrade, and I'm finding it really useful in my daily life.",
            "I recently added an Amazon Echo Spot to my smart home setup, primarily to complement my existing Amazon Echo Show, and it has fit perfectly into its role.\n\nMy Echo Show is wall-mounted in the living room and acts as our main hub, especially for interacting with our Ring doorbell and video security system. I wanted a smaller, less obtrusive device for the bedroom, mainly to receive Ring alarm notifications, and the Echo Spot has been ideal for this.\n\nIt works seamlessly with all my Ring devices. Notifications come through promptly, and the small screen is just enough to see what's happening or to quickly arm/disarm the system if needed. The compact size is perfect for a nightstand, and it doesn't feel intrusive like a larger screen might in the bedroom.\n\nWhile I use the Echo Show for more involved tasks and video feeds, the Echo Spot is an excellent, reliable secondary device for quick updates and alerts, particularly for the Ring ecosystem. If you're looking for a compact smart display to extend your Ring notifications to another room, the Echo Spot is a great choice.",
            "El dise√±o de este ultimo echo (spot) es increible, yo lo compre en blanco por el contraste del negro de la pantalla, pero estoy seguro que en los dem√°s colores de igual manera se ver√° muy bonito.\n\nHablando de funcionalidades:\n- B√°sicamente funciona de igual manera que cualquer otro echo/alexa, aunque puede variar una que otra cosa debido a la nueva pantalla integrada.\n\n- Las animaciones que se muestran en diferentes ocasiones (al pasar un minuto en el rejol, al poner musica, al crear una alarma, etc., etc.) son muy bonitas, puedes personalizar tanto el reloj con diferentes dise√±os (que probablemente con el tiempo se agreguen m√°s) y con diferentes colores (magenta, violeta, verde aqua, azul, naranja y lima).\n\n- La pantalla es t√°ctil/touch y por esto, puedes acceder a configuraciones rapidas dentro del mismo Echo Spot (para una configuraci√≥n mas detallada, abre la app de Alexa), ya sea, cambiar el color y dise√±o del reloj, regular el brillo de la pantalla, bajar/subir volumen, etc., etc.\n\nPuntos malos:\n\n- El Echo lleg√≥ en una bolsa de carton con burbujas (al menos a mi y a varios m√°s) siento que al ser un dispositivo electr√≥nico, deber√≠a llegar al menos en una caja de cart√≥n con mucha m√°s protecci√≥n\n\n- La pantalla no es un circulo como se podr√≠a pensar, es un rectangulo en el centro de toda la parte negra. Cuando est√° el brillo alto o al m√°ximo, se notan los bordes de esta. De lo contrario, en espacios obscuros/no tan iluminados, no se nota para nada.\n\nConclusi√≥n:\nPor el precio que esta en este momento a miembros Prime, es una excelente opci√≥n. Como se aprecia en las fotos, se nota mas grande que una Alexa con reloj (olvid√© el nombre) pero no es tanto como para estorbar, el tama√±o es ideal. vali√≥ mucho la pena por el simple hecho de ser mucho mas elegante, con mas funcionalidades y obviamente, mas nueva y actualizada.\n\nSeguramente con el tiempo se agreguen funcionalidades para facilitar muchas mas tareas. Compra esta Alexa si quieres tener un reloj digital, una bocina de buen sonido y vol√∫men y obviamente, una asistente para tus tareas :)))\n\nGracias por llegar hasta aqui y espero haber aclarado la mayoria de dudas :))"

            "Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.\n\nSound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.\n\nNoise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's \"universal\" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.\n\nBattery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.\n\nWarranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.\n\nAppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.\n\nAppleCare tips:\nYou don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.\n\nYou can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.\n\nYou can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.\n\nUsing AirPods with Android:\n\nApple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.\n\nIf you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find \"AirPods\" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.\n\nFAIR WARNING:\n\nYou will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.\n\nI was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called \"AirPopUp\". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.\n\nFor Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.\n\nGalaxy Buds features:\nMade by Samsung\nAudio powered by AKG\nRubber ear bud tips\nPair with Samsung device to get the most\nWireless charging case\nActive noise cancellation\nComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)\nIncludes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.\n\nI know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled \"Galaxy Wearable\". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.\n\nApple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.",
            "This is actually my second time buying the Apple AirPods (2nd Gen Wireless) and that should tell you just how good they are. I lost one of my earbuds (pretty sure it was the right one that fell out of my pocket), and without even thinking twice, I went and bought a brand new pair. That‚Äôs how much I love them.\nThe sound quality is top-tier music, calls, voice notes, everything sounds crisp, clear, and smooth. The connection to my iPhone is quick and reliable every single time.\nOne of the best things, though, is how comfortable they are. Sometimes I even forget they‚Äôre in my ears they‚Äôre that lightweight and well-fitting. No pain, no slipping, just a perfect fit all day long.\n\nThe charging case is fast and convenient, and the battery life holds up really well throughout the day. Whether I‚Äôm on the go or just chilling at home, these AirPods never let me down.\nIf you‚Äôre thinking about getting them, go for it. The fact that I‚Äôve bought them twice says everything",
            "I gave these AirPods as a gift for my kiddo. They great quality and work amazing so far. They have had them for a while and there has not been any issues. These are great quality for the price. They seem to fit perfectly in the right size and very durable. I need to pair myself not leave for work but for working out cause you‚Äôre great for noise levels with great sound quality.",
            "I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with their performance. The setup was incredibly easy‚Äîjust open the case near your iPhone and you‚Äôre connected in seconds. The sound quality is crisp and well-balanced, whether I‚Äôm listening to music, taking calls, or watching videos. What really stands out is the seamless switching between Apple devices, which makes multitasking effortless. The fit is comfortable and surprisingly secure, even during workouts. Battery life is solid too, lasting several hours on a single charge, and the charging case gives me peace of mind throughout the day. Volume is great as well",
            "This is such a clever idea for speakers to take anywhere. I can't believe they produce such great sound. I recommend them."

            "For more than nine years running, I have had Amazon Echo devices on every level of my home. An Amazon Echo lived in the kitchen, the family room, the office, and four bedrooms. All were Generation 1 devices, you know....the tall tower-like devices that if they fell would severely damage your foot!!!üò´ Then one day, all of my Generation 1 devices went off-line and ceased to function!!üòÆ I contacted Amazon for help, and was told the Generation 1 devices were no longer supported by Amazon and could not receive any updates. I can't comprehend how 7 separate devices just stopped working all at the same time. My entire family has come to depend on Alexa to play music, news, weather, podcasts, and many other apps we added to the mix. I ordered a new 5th-generation Echo Dot, and it was delivered overnight. Set-up was easy-peasy using my Alexa app on my phone. It was connected to my internet, and the settings were selected in just a few minutes. The sound from my old Echo was dynamic, but this new Echo Dot produces great-sounding music with the right blend of bass, mid-range tones, and highs brilliantly!!üòÉ This Echo Dot is small in its dimensions but VERY BIG IN PERFORMANCE!!!üòÑ The bass is deeper and more pronounced, and the mid-range vocals are more defined and clear!! This new Echo has exceeded my expectations regarding punching out some music!!! This first purchase of the Amazon Echo Dot was my test device, which, if great, would be purchased in greater quantity and set up in each room missing an Echo device.I believe I'll be ordering more of these to satisfy the family!!! The design is very pleasant to look at, and the rounded shape looks more at home than my previous 1st generation units!! I set the Echo so that if I was talking to the unit and stopped, I didn't have to say \"Alexa\" to wake the device. This unit waits for my next words seamlessly making commands flow much more smoothly!! You can also set whether the Echo, when woken, makes a sound or remains quiet. I like the awake notification especially if I'm not looking directly at the device. This Echo also has a temperature sensor which could make it more repsonsive if it were running a home thermostat!! I like the \"+\" and \"-\" bottons on the top of the device to control volume as opposed to turning the top of my old Echos to increase or decrease the volume. You can also, like the older models, use your voice to tell Alexa which level of volume you prefer. Whether you're playing music, listening to news, or getting a weather report, this device can be muted just by touching the top of the Echo!!! NICE FEATURE!!!!üòÉ It will remain muted until you touch the top again which will pick up where you stopped the unit!!! CONVENIENT!!!!üòâ I have also found that this newer generation Echo is much more responsive to voice commands and follows through with exactly you asked for in a flash!!! I discovered that if I didn't know how to install an app or function, or wasn't aware of what's available to run on the unit, Alexa is on the job either describing apps or functions she can perform, or she can tell me how to set up an app or functions in easy to follow clear directions!!!!üòâ I haven't in the past set up lights or the house thermostat, but since this Echo seems better suited to the tasks than my previous generation devive, I think I'll venture into the world of Alexa controlled convenience items!!! üö©I rate this new 5th Generation Echo Dot a super-solid 10 out of 10, because of the units ease of set-up, the quick and crisp responses from Alexa, the improved sound whether playing music or even just news, the addition of volume controls on the topo of this device, and the affordable price of this amazingly handy device!!!! I highly recommend this new 5th Generation Echo Dot to anyone who has gone through the same situation as I with my older devices shutting down, or to new first time buyers that have yet to experience the convenience and helpfulness of owning an Amazon Echo device!!! I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed in the least with the function and performance of this newest generation Echo device!!!!üòä",
            "My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.\n\nSo, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 ‚Äì aside from familiarity with the brand ‚Äì was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.\n\nFirst thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room ‚Äì the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.\n\nFirst thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.\n\nSo after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.\n\nI can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say ‚Äì though I may be wrong about this ‚Äì that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only ‚Äì at this point anyway ‚Äì required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.\n\nNow, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter ‚Äì I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal ‚Äì also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important ‚Äì add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!\n\nAnother new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.\n\nThere is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.\n\nOne borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections ‚Äì they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.\n\nOnce again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome \"drop-in\" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!",
            "Absolutely Love My Alexa!\n\nI couldn‚Äôt be happier with my purchase! Alexa has truly transformed my home into a smart and more convenient space. From playing music, setting reminders, checking the weather, controlling my lights, and even answering random questions ‚Äî it does it all with ease. The voice recognition is spot-on, even from across the room, and the sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for such a compact device.\n\nSetup was quick and seamless, and I love how well it integrates with my other smart devices. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant 24/7. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their home with a touch of voice-activated tech.\n\nIf you‚Äôre on the fence ‚Äî go for it! You won‚Äôt regret it."

            "I've wanted a pair of Beats since the late 2000's but never had the money to get a pair. I wanted to finally try something new and on a whim, purchased these since they were on sale. I wanted to compare the quality to the AirPods that I've had for a few years now. I was very happy when I put these on and found that they were almost similar in sound quality. I still will have to give AirPod the better sound rating but these Beats are a very very close next. These do not have noise cancellation, however the fit of the cushions on the headphones are actually quite snug so it does help with blocking some noise out, all noise is gone when blasting music of course, but don't damage your ears doing this for long periods! As others have stated, the Cloud Pink is not \"pink\". It's more of a white with a deep hue. They are comfortable and do have a little bit of weight to them so they don't fall off as easily if you're bending down to grab something.",
            "Lifelong Studio and Solo Beats user. These are the most comfortable Solos I have owned. They don‚Äôt slide around or fall off like my Solo 3 s used to. They are pretty much the perfect tightness and seal on my ear. I prefer the outer ear coverage of the Solo. This Solo 4 version has softer foam on the ears and they moved the power light to the left ear. The Major Difference is the Type C Charger instead of the Micro USB. The Type C is much better. These Solo 4s sound louder than my 3s but not by much. They worked to connect on Bluetooth Steam on my PC. In the Game Rivals it would play normally on the different lobby screens. Once I entered a match the Audio would completely distort. Only while in matchmaking. While I‚Äôm Menu and the rest of Rivals it sounded normal. Could just be my PC. Just a heads up if you plan on gaming with these. Microphone did not work for Voice Chat in Steam.",
            "The Beats Solo 4 Wireless Headphones offer a sleek design and impressive battery life, lasting up to **50 hours** on a single charge. The **Personalized Spatial Audio** with dynamic head tracking enhances the listening experience, making music feel immersive . The **UltraPlush ear cushions** provide decent comfort, though some users may find the on-ear fit a bit tight over long periods.\nSound quality is solid, with **custom-built 40mm transducers** delivering clear highs and balanced bass, though it may not satisfy audiophiles looking for deep, rich tones. The addition of **USB-C and 3.5mm audio cable support** for high-resolution lossless audio is a great. Overall, the Beats Solo 4 are a stylish and reliable choice for casual listeners who prioritize battery life and convenience over premium sound quality.",
            "This was a gift for my niece and let me tell you she is obsessed with these headphones. First of all the color is great and the sound quality is amazing. I tried them on and heard a little bit of music and I was able to activate noise cancellation just like the AirPods these headphones made a perfect gift for her because she likes to go to the gym. I asked her if they wouldn‚Äôt fall off her head while she was running on the treadmill or working out and she said they stayed on her and didn‚Äôt sip off. The quality of the battery is amazing. She said that the headphones charged quick and the battery life last about three days.\n\nThe button makes it easier for her to work out and listen to music at the same time. After hearing all these good things and how excited she was, it was definitely worth the money that I paid.",
            "Received on time, open and pared without any issues. When i paired, i did receive a dialog box stating the this device was already registered to another account and that I had to transfer this device to my account. I pressed OK and no issues. For the price, im not worried they are under warranty by apple. Loved this purchase, great fit, amazing sound. Im happy",
            "I love these beats, huge upgrade from my AirPods! Like I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how much I love them. DEFINITELY worth the value for money seriously! Buttons work great! It one button on right side to turn it off and on, on the left side the outer circle controls the volume going up & down, the inner circle controls the microphone and hang up button on the phone. Pressing it once mutes, pressing it twice hangs up. Playing music same for the outer buttons aka the volume the inner button only pauses the music. The sound is perfect! No muffling or nothing! Durability I haven‚Äôt had them for too long maybe just 2 months but nothing wrong with them no cords hanging out no broken nothing! Ease of use, excellent! This is a very great purchase!",
            "I love listening to music and I like to tune everything out. I like the first pair of AirPods that came out because they were small and fixed perfectly with my ear piercings. But it gets annoyed when you‚Äôre working out, or changing and they keep falling out etc. They got dirty too fast and sometimes if you misplace them it‚Äôs hard to find them. So I opt to go back to beats. I decided to do the all black for a clean look and it‚Äôs one of my favorite colors. Anyways I ordered and they came the next day. Fast shipping and nice packing. When I opened the box the beats were charged which was cool so I can try them on right away. I have a three year old toddler who cries/ throws tantrums every other second. I can‚Äôt hear the cry when I‚Äôm listening to music. I can barely hear myself if I‚Äôm singing loudly. When I send voice notes then sound so clear and a bit loud depending on volume of your voice. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase would buy another pair!! Very secure on my head I can shake my head and not a slight of a move. Definitely good for the gym, running, cleaning and just to jam out. If outside I‚Äôll lower my volume or have one of my ears out to be able to hear because if not I won‚Äôt be aware of any of my surroundings lol.",
            "I'm a huge headphone collector always looking for good quality sets. A very long time ago I used to own the first beats generation whose quality was amazing... over time I started using other sets and brands like Sony, Bose, etc.. I have a lot of sets for particular purposes. Yes is right that these don't come with noise cancelling and that music doesn't stop when you take them off... but I was not looking for any high end/premium headphones, but instead something more simple, classic, that could deliver good sound quality. It is also true that its bass is not what it used to be, but this is to help to provide a better and more crisp sound. Apple indeed made a downgrade and I'm not a full fan of downgrading bass, but being able to use the spatial sound feature in these is great, it makes music much more enjoyable with clear vocals and you can actually distinguish instruments better than just having a full blast on the bass.\nAgain, I wasn't going for a noise cancelling set, and its \"passive\" noise cancelling is good enough (not for very loud places like airplanes though) but that's why I have other sets in case I want noise cancelling.\nThis stays on pretty well while working out and even though is not specified it does feel sweat resistance and they feel pretty comfortable.\n\nLove their size btw, small, compact enough to fit in a my already bulky backpack. It came with a very nice case/pack where I can fill with a few more stuff, so that's a big plus.\n\nNot sure other models, but I loved my blue ones.\n\nNow... even though they feel quite comfortable, not sure they would be in the long run... they get a little less comfortable after an hour of use or so, bringing a little pressure in your ears, particularly the right side near the charging port (something odd about it makes it uncomfortable). Cushion is not as stiff like other brands, but it's ok... not the best, but manageable.\n\nOverall I do give these a 5 star because of the price/quality value, their sound quality, durability, and how convenient this are.\n\nIs probably not a must buy, but I would buy them again.\n\nnote: My wife tried them and now she wants a pair too LOL, she loved them... So will buy another set just for her.",
            "Great choice, quality and color, use them at gym, when travelling or just to relax",
            "The noise cancelling is perfect and they're easy to travel with. The traveling case it comes with is small. My only small nitpick is that they aren't as pink as shown on the photo, and my charging cable doesn't match the color either. The cord is Grey which an odd color in this case. No problems at all otherwise. Highly recommend."

            "Kindle vs Boox Palma\n\nLove this thing!\n\nThe 2024 Kindle Basic is probably the best e-reader you can get *at this price*. but to be honest, if I bought it again, I'd probably spend an extra $45 for the Kindle paperwhite.\n\nThe battery life is incredible‚ÄîI easily get 50 days between charges, which blows my mind. It‚Äôs lightweight, easy to read on, and does the job well if you just want a simple, reliable reading device.\n\nThat said, I do wish it had a blue light filter for nighttime reading, and after using my Boox Palma 1, I realize how limited the Kindle is in terms of customization. I use the Boox way more because of how flexible it is.\n\nIf you‚Äôre just looking for the basics and unbeatable battery life and reliability, this is the one. But if you want more control over your reading experience, definitely look into Boox Palma 1 or the Kindle Paperwhite for the blue light filter.",
            "I have only had this for about a week. It is fairly close to the simplicity of my old kindle keyboard. I just wanted a device I could load books on to read and not need a computer science degree to use it. I take grandson's to college credit classes and spend a lot of time waiting since they don't yet drive. This little kindle is a perfect size to slip in my purse or in my computer bag. It has two choices for the lighting of the screen. I really like the dark setting as I can read at night and don't need to turn on a light. You can see the screen and read easily but it is not bright enough to wake up my husband. Since I was getting a kindle but didn't know which one my daughter waited and then ordered a screen protector and a carrying case for my Mother's Day gift which I would highly recommend for it. Even with the case it is very light weight.",
            "It‚Äôs honestly been a good two years since I‚Äôve sat down and genuinely read a book‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶Too long! When I saw this kindle in the shop (the matcha green one) - I was a little hesitant at first. Like why do I need an ebook if I can just order hard covers or paperbacks? But this thing is tiny and mighty! I‚Äôve probably charged it once a month, and I get to read before bed by using the black light option. It‚Äôs perfectly tiny where I can just hold it in one hand - and read even laying on my side! Perfect for falling asleep to a good story! The matcha green color is also super cute and not distracting! I used to have trouble focusing when I sat down to read large hard-covers but somehow this kindle helps me read more than I have ever read in my LIFE!",
            "I have to admit I was not sure I would be OK with a small screen. My husband reads his Kindle books on his phone and I just can‚Äôt. So I thought this was getting very close and had trepidation. However given the price point, I really wanted to give this newest Kindle a try for two reasons. Arthritis in my hands and travel.\n\nI use a mini iPad for most all of my Kindle reading, primarily because I love the page turning feature and like the option of being able to jump to other options‚Äîmessaging or the Amazon app etc. if I just quickly want to, while reading. Also because I love full color for home page and certain art books and other selected books.\n\nHowever, while small, it is a bit heavy.\n\nThis new Kindle is just right and light. I love it. I can put this in my purse and it‚Äôs not going to weigh it down. Something very important to me as well. It‚Äôs so slender too. I would get that clear cover though, that helps with the grip, and does not add to the thickness.\n\nThe screen is so crisp. I am a 67 year old who has had cataract surgery but still have floaters.\n\nSo the screen, brightness, crispness and the ability to comfortably hold the device is important to me. Knocked all of those out of the park as well. I can hold this thing for hours and even with arthritic hands not feel pain. I don‚Äôt need to rest it on anything while reading and that‚Äôs a game changer.\n\nI am of course aware I can change the font, but I didn‚Äôt want a screen so small I‚Äôd have to make the font so large I‚Äôd get only a paragraph per page. I find that this size is like a better, brighter paperback book where I can slightly tweak the font to perfection giving me that book experience which also is important to me.\n\nPage turning is instant. Perfect.\n\nBattery is a workhorse. Best yet. Hours later still at 90% which I have NEVER had on any device using it even with moderate use.\n\nThe photo shows the size of my mini iPad on the left. So while the size difference isn‚Äôt that much, the weight is.\n\nI own other much older Kindles. A Kindle Fire. An IPad. And various other electronics including other digital readers I really like. For travel. For going to a Dr.‚Äôs appointment, for just taking this with, hands down, this is the best. I LOVE it and didn‚Äôt think I would so much! I love it so much I‚Äôm using it more and more around the house even though I prefer full-color on my home page and the page animation!"

            "I swear I already wrote a review with photos and a video, but here we are! I LOVE This little beast. I have Echo Dots in my bedroom, bathroom, and guest room, but I needed access to my Smart Home features from my desk. I am disabled and my mornings are very rough. I wanted a screen to occasionally watch videos or see a better display of the weather. Listed are some accessibility features that I love. I have FND, Functional Neurological Disorder, which involves some speech processing and speaking delay. Only occasionally, but enough that I need accommodations to function better. These features make this little echo an excellent companion to any disabled or elderly human you know. We need any and all strategies to function in a culture that sees disability as a personal failure. I am loving it so far! The screen is clear, vibrant, and responsive. I can dim it quickly (I have severe neurological photophobia) and it responds well to my voice. I have no complaints and have been using it for over 2 months. Waited until it went on sale for about $68.\n\nlive captions\nreduced speaking rate\ntap screen to interact\nadaptive listening - life changing!!\nmore time to respond",
            "Absolutely love the Echo Show 5! I use it as bedside clock and smart assistant in room but It‚Äôs the perfect size for a nightstand, kitchen counter, or office desk‚Äîcompact but packed with features. The screen is super crisp and responsive, making it easy to check the weather, watch videos, view security camera feeds, or even make video calls.\n\nAlexa works flawlessly as always, and the sound quality is surprisingly rich for such a small device. The integration with smart home devices is seamless‚ÄîI can control lights, check the doorbell cam, and play music all with simple voice commands.\n\nAlso worth mentioning: the packaging was sleek and had a premium feel, which made the unboxing experience that much better.\n\nFor anyone looking to add a smart assistant with a screen to their home setup, the Echo Show 5 is an excellent choice. Highly recommended.",
            "Small Screen, Big Upgrade ‚Äî Twice the Bass, Double the Vibes üîäüì∫üíô\n\nThis Echo Show 5 (Cloud Blue) is small but mighty. Don‚Äôt let the size fool you ‚Äî the sound is crisp, clear, and bass-heavy thanks to the upgraded speakers. Whether I‚Äôm jamming in the kitchen or catching headlines while brushing my teeth, this thing delivers.\n\nThe smart display is super responsive, and I love how it shows weather, reminders, calendar updates, camera feeds, and even TikTok recipes ‚Äî all hands-free with Alexa. You can make video calls, stream music, watch the news, and control smart home devices, all in one stylish little package.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs talk about the Cloud Blue color ‚Äî it‚Äôs fresh, calming, and looks amazing on a nightstand or countertop. Also makes a great gift for someone who loves tech but wants a device that doesn‚Äôt take up a ton of space.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to upgrade your smart setup or add some convenience and style to your daily routine, the new Echo Show 5 is where it‚Äôs at.",
            "Initial Response for 1 May 2025:\n\nI feel this is a lightweight version of what they can offer. I felt disappointed in limited local \"skills\" (not fond of what they call them, hard to remember the name for available widgets/apps/programs).\n\nIt seems as if this may be outdated soon? It has that feel to it. It was not as easy to set up as other digital things in my life are. It took a while. Not as modern as I had hoped.\n\nIt has a beautiful display.\n\nThe voice options are decent. I liked a few of them, though there weren't many options.\n\nI managed to launch \"Wheel of Fortune\" (skill/program/app), but I did not try it because I was showing my husband how good (and bad) it was working out for me.\n\nThe music sounded good, what music I was able to access for free. Limited there, too. It tried to sell me a subscription by offering a trial. I hope that didn't go through. lol I said no.\n\nEasy to close shutter. Slides right over. :)\nBeautiful (already available) images in Photo Frame (Slide Show).\nThe cord is white. For the charcoal version, as stated by another reviewer, it stands out. I was prepared for that. O.o\n\nI am still playing around with it. I just got it today. User Interface is definitely not my fave, but for this price, I feel I got what I paid for, and I am happy enough with that.\n\nWhat this cannot do, my computer, iPhone, and iPad can do. I guess, combined, I have what I need. lol\n\nPlease read the other reviews and watch the prices, and versions released. I think both may matter. Technology can move fast sometimes.\n\nI suppose it depends on what you want it for, if you will like it. I'm really, really picky. ^.^\n\nSo far, not bad. 4/5, 8/10.\n\nUpdate: 3 May 2025\nI'm learning it's \"language\" a bit better. Still settings things up. It seems to \"learn\" your interests by asking if you want it to show more or less of something. That has helped a lot!\n\nI can't find a way to give it a custom name, but I did find where you can change the name, so I did. :D\n\nIt's growing on me. We're getting along pretty well, though I still think the software could use an update/tune up, as well as the user interface (UI).",
            "I was getting sick and tired of my old semi Smart alarm clock. So I opted in for something totally smart and easy to use while maintaining a sleek tiny footprint on my nightstand. I nicknamed this Alexa my smart alarm clock. Con, doesn't include a fast wireless charger on top or USB ports to charge a phone. I don't even think you can play media from a phone wirelessly. Better use a cloud service.",
            "I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long to get an Alexa. I love this thing. I have set up schedules to play music in the morning, I do wish I could figure out how to get it to play music on it self & another speaker at the same time.\nI love that I can ‚Äúcall it‚Äù & have a FaceTime with the kids while I am not home & honestly stopped burning food now that I just ask for alarms instead of thinking I will remember to take the food out of the oven",
            "It does what it advertises. I‚Äôm very happy with the product.!üòÅ",
            "The stand is a no brainer as it allows the screen to be easily seen especially in the dark.",
            "Makes the echo easier to use and looks good.",

            "I lover Anker's products and have used many of them throughout the years. I have charge cables, power bricks, and portable re-chargeable power banks. All are still in working order years later, and have worked flawlessly. When I was searching for a new power strip for my home office, I immediately looked for the Anker brand to see if they made one. They sure do and it's just as awesome as the other Anker products I own! I chose the strip that also has USB ports because my outlets in the office are limited, and I need to charge various things like blue tooth headphones and my personal cell phone. The cord on the strip could be longer, but I made it work for my office set up without moving too many things around.\n\nThe switch on this unit allows the power to all devices plugged in to be turned off. This is perfect for my needs, and will also save power from things being plugged in all the time. I highly recommend the Anker brand for any of your power or charging needs.",
            "Trying to do some cable organization at my home office desk, I was looking at options to make things neater. After much research into various charging stations I decided to go with this one, which has 2 USB, 1USBC and a whole bunch of plugs.\nIt really helps that the plug of the extension fits flat into the wall and the available plugs face away , allowing me to connect the equivalent of 2 strips into this one strip.",
            "My old Belkin strip actually shorted and was tripping my GFCI over and over so it was time to chuck that POS. This Anker strip has a great layout to allow odd sized plugs, USB, and indicator light to let you know it's on and working without having to check the switch. 5 stars as usual for Anker, what can I say?",
            "This power strip feels incredibly well made, solid construction all around. The extension cord length is as advertised, thick, durable, and clearly built to last. Devices plug in securely and stay firmly in place, which is something I really appreciate. I use it under my home office desk, and it‚Äôs been reliable from day one. If I ever need another, I‚Äôll definitely buy this one again.",
            "This works fine, but the unusual arrangement of the outlets doesn't actually enable me to fit more bulky chargers. So I might as well have bought 2 outlet strips, which would also provide 12 outlets, but fewer with bulky chargers.\n\nI am using one of the USB-A ports to keep my spare tablet charged, but I don't think this will provide more than 12 or 15 watts - USB-A is never supposed to give more than 15 watts, and I don't know what the USB-C port really delivers.\n\nBulky chargers along the side can block the outlets in the middle, very sadly. And the outlets are not spaced farther apart than normal power strips.\n\nReally, the best bet is to buy \"extra spaced outlet strips\", this is just a 12-plug normally spaced outlet strip, which means it might only fit 6 bulky chargers.\n\nIt may be less likely to fall on its side than an outlet strip, but I don't think that justifies the price. I am not particularly troubled by outlet strips lying on their sides, it is how they very often end up if they aren't affixed by screws.",
            "This works great and has USB and USB-C and lots of space for plugs. I used almost all of them all at once for a few months and it worked very well. Never tripped the breaker. Great for a dorm as well and reaches pretty far. Doesn‚Äôt make any noise. Travels easily.",
            "An amazing surge protector for the price. It is made by Anker so it is definitely a premium product and amazing value. I personally use it just for my PC and it's peripherals, so I don't apply too many devices to just one power strip, but it provides even USB-A and USB-C ports for convenience! The cord length is not the best for my particular setup, but fits just right to have everything placed perfectly.",
            "Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one's view's and by trying to make it objectified, and by considering each and every one's valid opinion, I honestly believe that I completely forgot what I was going to say."

            "For more than nine years running, I have had Amazon Echo devices on every level of my home. An Amazon Echo lived in the kitchen, the family room, the office, and four bedrooms. All were Generation 1 devices, you know....the tall tower-like devices that if they fell would severely damage your foot!!!üò´ Then one day, all of my Generation 1 devices went off-line and ceased to function!!üòÆ I contacted Amazon for help, and was told the Generation 1 devices were no longer supported by Amazon and could not receive any updates. I can't comprehend how 7 separate devices just stopped working all at the same time. My entire family has come to depend on Alexa to play music, news, weather, podcasts, and many other apps we added to the mix. I ordered a new 5th-generation Echo Dot, and it was delivered overnight. Set-up was easy-peasy using my Alexa app on my phone. It was connected to my internet, and the settings were selected in just a few minutes. The sound from my old Echo was dynamic, but this new Echo Dot produces great-sounding music with the right blend of bass, mid-range tones, and highs brilliantly!!üòÉ This Echo Dot is small in its dimensions but VERY BIG IN PERFORMANCE!!!üòÑ The bass is deeper and more pronounced, and the mid-range vocals are more defined and clear!! This new Echo has exceeded my expectations regarding punching out some music!!! This first purchase of the Amazon Echo Dot was my test device, which, if great, would be purchased in greater quantity and set up in each room missing an Echo device.I believe I'll be ordering more of these to satisfy the family!!! The design is very pleasant to look at, and the rounded shape looks more at home than my previous 1st generation units!! I set the Echo so that if I was talking to the unit and stopped, I didn't have to say \"Alexa\" to wake the device. This unit waits for my next words seamlessly making commands flow much more smoothly!! You can also set whether the Echo, when woken, makes a sound or remains quiet. I like the awake notification especially if I'm not looking directly at the device. This Echo also has a temperature sensor which could make it more repsonsive if it were running a home thermostat!! I like the \"+\" and \"-\" bottons on the top of the device to control volume as opposed to turning the top of my old Echos to increase or decrease the volume. You can also, like the older models, use your voice to tell Alexa which level of volume you prefer. Whether you're playing music, listening to news, or getting a weather report, this device can be muted just by touching the top of the Echo!!! NICE FEATURE!!!!üòÉ It will remain muted until you touch the top again which will pick up where you stopped the unit!!! CONVENIENT!!!!üòâ I have also found that this newer generation Echo is much more responsive to voice commands and follows through with exactly you asked for in a flash!!! I discovered that if I didn't know how to install an app or function, or wasn't aware of what's available to run on the unit, Alexa is on the job either describing apps or functions she can perform, or she can tell me how to set up an app or functions in easy to follow clear directions!!!!üòâ I haven't in the past set up lights or the house thermostat, but since this Echo seems better suited to the tasks than my previous generation devive, I think I'll venture into the world of Alexa controlled convenience items!!! üö©I rate this new 5th Generation Echo Dot a super-solid 10 out of 10, because of the units ease of set-up, the quick and crisp responses from Alexa, the improved sound whether playing music or even just news, the addition of volume controls on the topo of this device, and the affordable price of this amazingly handy device!!!! I highly recommend this new 5th Generation Echo Dot to anyone who has gone through the same situation as I with my older devices shutting down, or to new first time buyers that have yet to experience the convenience and helpfulness of owning an Amazon Echo device!!! I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed in the least with the function and performance of this newest generation Echo device!!!!üòä",
            "My previous Echo Dot, purchased back in 2018, was a third-generation. It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.\n\nSo, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 ‚Äì aside from familiarity with the brand ‚Äì was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.\n\nFirst thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room ‚Äì the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.\n\nFirst thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.\n\nSo after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.\n\nI can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say ‚Äì though I may be wrong about this ‚Äì that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only ‚Äì at this point anyway ‚Äì required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.\n\nNow, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter ‚Äì I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal ‚Äì also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important ‚Äì add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!\n\nAnother new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.\n\nThere is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.\n\nOne borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections ‚Äì they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.\n\nOnce again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in! Get this speaker if you are looking to build a smart home, and for best results, get more than one so you can use the awesome \"drop-in\" intercom system, and truly awaken the potential of the smart home!",
            "Absolutely Love My Alexa!\n\nI couldn‚Äôt be happier with my purchase! Alexa has truly transformed my home into a smart and more convenient space. From playing music, setting reminders, checking the weather, controlling my lights, and even answering random questions ‚Äî it does it all with ease. The voice recognition is spot-on, even from across the room, and the sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for such a compact device.\n\nSetup was quick and seamless, and I love how well it integrates with my other smart devices. It‚Äôs like having a personal assistant 24/7. Highly recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their home with a touch of voice-activated tech.\n\nIf you‚Äôre on the fence ‚Äî go for it! You won‚Äôt regret it."

            "I recently purchased this power strip, and it's been a fantastic addition to my workspace. With multiple outlets and USB ports, it allows me to plug in all my devices‚Äîlaptop, phone charger, monitor, and even a desk lamp‚Äîwithout any hassle. The surge protection feature gives me peace of mind, especially during storms or power fluctuations. I also appreciate the long cord, which makes it easy to place exactly where I need it. The build quality feels solid and durable, and the sleek, compact design doesn't take up much room. Overall, it's a reliable and convenient solution for anyone needing extra outlets and safe, organized power access.",
            "I tried to zap myself silly but the surge protector on this thing is too good and stopped the voltage from shocking me past a state of unconsciousness. I put a paper clip in each outlet hole and turned it on while was touching each paper clip and in the flash of a second I was blasted half way across the room but the power zapped itself off after that so it's perfectly safe.",
            "It was the perfect size to mount on my end table next to the couch so I could keep my computers charged and phone charging cable handy and have a little lamp on the table. Nice added touch with the USB C and the other USB ports!",
            "This power strip is a decent value, but, as others have mentioned, the indicator light is hard to see unless you look directly down into it. According to the instructions, that blue light indicates the surge protection is functional. That is important because a surge can blow out the protection circuit but leave the power flow on. Some nicer strips have separate \"power is on\" and \"protection is active\" indicators.\nThe other thing to note is that this strip is only rated for 10A, not 15A. I knew that when I purchased it, and it is fine for my computer setup, but not suitable for something like a microwave oven. Unpacking it one will note the light gauge of the power cord compared to 15A strips. This is not necessarily a bad thing if it meets your needs.",
            "This has the outlets facing The Correct Direction! Most others only permit the smallest of plugs because they all face The Wrong Way! Evidently, the provider actually uses a power bar!",
            "Works perfectly the cord is a great length especially for the price. It has USB ports. And it seems to be put together pretty well.",
            "Surge protector for sure works well and will turn off if you have to much going on differently worth buying",
            "Works well. I like the USB ports, and there are enough other outlets. Would buy again.",

            "I bought this extender for a busy outlet located above a counter: an outlet where I was constantly having to plug and unplug different things, and a counter on which it would be convenient to charge tablets and phones. There are many such extenders available; I chose this one because it already had a great reputation (over 33,000 ratings when I bought it, averaging 4.5 stars), because its 110-120V outlets are at different angles and spaced far enough apart to accommodate most \"wall warts\" without sacrificing an outlet, and because it has 3 Type A USB charge ports and 1 Type C USB charge port. I also bought it for stability in a conventional American wall outlet: this extender has a center hole positioned where you can drive a screw through the wall plate fastener screw hole of your standard duplex outlet. An extra-long center screw with the standard thread for this purpose is included. Given the amount of force that multiple 3-prong cords and wall warts can exert on an outlet extender, I highly recommend choosing an outlet extender that has this feature. Added bonus: this extender has a blue LED light around the center screw, so you can see at a glance if the extender's outlets are energized.\n\nVery important: I do not recommend this outlet extender for Decora outlets, as Decora outlets have their wall plate fastener screws on their short sides rather than in the center. Unless you use the center screw, the only thing holding this extender to the outlet will be a single 3-prong plug and a plastic stud that fits into the grounding hole for the second plug, which likely isn't enough to prevent the weight of cords and wall warts from pulling the extender out of the outlet, possibly creating a fire hazard.\n\nSo far, I'm very happy with my outlet extender. I found no dead outlets, and the individual outlets hold plugs well.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n- This outlet extender is too wide for use in 4-way wall outlets. (You could use it in such an outlet, but doing so would partly cover up two of the outlets, so your net gain would be one 110-120V outlet and, of course, the USB outlets.)\n\n- The user manual warns that this extender won't fit GFCI outlets or outlets with built-in USB outlets.\n\n- While the extender has an overall rating of 1,875W, which is the maximum rating for a standard 15A circuit, each individual outlet is only rated at 750W. This makes it unsuitable for use with electric heaters, as well as many air conditioners and small appliances such as toasters and air fryers.\n\n- It's unclear from the manual or the markings on the extender if each individual USB port supports up to 4.2A at 5V, or if the two Type A USB ports closest to the brand label support 4.2A at 5V each and the 3rd Type A USB port and the Type C USB port support a combined output of 4.2A at 5V, or if 4.2A at 5V is the maximum output of all the USB ports combined. There's nothing to prevent you from plugging in up to 4 USB devices, but depending on whether and how power output is divided among the USB ports, multiple devices plugged into this extender may charge more slowly than a single device plugged in. I will have to do some experiments and update this review.\n\n- None of the USB ports on this extender support fast charging or devices that draw more than 4.2A at 5V. You cannot charge or run your laptop from any of these USB ports.\n\n- This extender provides surge protection. While this is generally a good thing, that also means you can't plug powerline network transceivers into it, and it will block the powerline networking backhaul feature of a powerline+wifi mesh kit such as the TP-Link Deco PX-50.\n\n- A general caveat about surge protection: If you're buying this because you think the surge protection will save your appliances from a lightning strike, think again. Lightning is powerful enough to jump through air, which is about the best insulator there is. If lightning strikes your home, there is no plug-in surge protector made that will prevent it from blowing out your appliances. If you live in a place that gets frequent electrical storms and this is a risk for homes in your area, consult a qualified electrician for a solution that mitigates the effects of a direct lightning strike.\n\n- This extender's power indicator light, which surrounds the center screw, is blue. If blue light tends to keep you awake at night, then you may want to consider a different model for use in your bedroom.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this outlet extender, and I recommend it.",
            "This outlet was very easy to install. I purchased this item for my garage ceiling outlet that faces downward. I have an outlet in the ceiling that the garage door opener connects to. We've recently flipped our garage into a hang out / play room for the kids with games and such. So we mounted a party dj light to the metal framing of the garage door (right beneath the outlet) to light up the room for party nights. The party light is powered by a USB port. Kids (and us parents) love it.\n\nSo the two main reasons this particular outlet worked for me:\n\n1. It screws in rather than just plugged in. Since my outlet is in the ceiling facing downward, the screw keeps it firmly attached to the ceiling. I don't have to worry about it falling out and hurting anyone. The weight of connecting devices to it may cause it to fall out otherwise. But being able to screw it in adds all the durability you need from that perspective.\n\n2. I needed both USB and standard power ports. I needed standard for my garage door motor to plug into and I need USB for my party light. And there are LOTS of extra ports for expansion. I'm thinking of adding some black lights up there to shine down on the air hockey table for some glow in the dark gaming. Ha ha.\n\nOther info:\nIn my opinion, you may not even have to remove the existing outlet face plate cover (which only takes 30 seconds if you did). This device is large enough in most cases to go right over the standard face plate and the screw is long enough to go through both this device and the original faceplate and still securely screw. That said, if you are able to remove the original face plate, it's still probably best practice to do so.\n\nAll in all. This was cheap enough and easy enough. I do not regret my purchase at all and would buy this again for a situation that needs both standard outlet ports and USB charging ports.",
            "This wall outlet extender does its job! I chose this one because I could remove my wall outlet's faceplate allowing the extender to sit flush against the wall. You don't have to remove your faceplate and in fact, the rear of the unit is recessed to allow for this. But for my outlet, it still left a very small gap between wall and extender, so I removed my faceplate. This is just the way I preferred to install it. I tested the USB-A voltage and the three ports provided 5 volts.\n\nMy only quibble is, I wish it had a second USB-C port. Two USB-A and two USB-C would have been my choice, but I could not find an extender on Amazon that met that criteria and fit flush against the wall. I did buy one almost a year ago that fit that criteria, but that company no longer has any to purchase.",
            "I‚Äôm sure it works well but I returned it cause it set too far out.",
            "This outlet extender is exactly what I needed! The 3-sided design is super smart‚Äîit lets you plug in multiple bulky adapters without blocking any other outlets. With 5 AC outlets, 4 USB ports (including a USB-C!), and 1680J surge protection, it‚Äôs perfect for my home office and great for travel, too.\n\nEverything charges fast, and it feels solid and well-made. It plugs right into the wall and stays secure, no wobbling. I love that it‚Äôs ETL listed, so I feel safe using it with all my electronics. Great value and functionality‚Äîdefinitely a must-have for tech-heavy households!",
            "Well made just plug it in and use it. I‚Äôd buy again.",

            "My significant other and I took a 6-week trip last year to Europe, and had just heard of AirTags. I found this 4-pack for one hundred and decided to take a chance on them. That seemed a little expensive to me, but everything Apple is expensive. These are gamechangers! I bought the silicone AirTag holders to slip them in and protect them, as well as make it easier to grab them. I know traveler hackers recommend carrying everything in a carry-on now, and *never* checking luggage; but we didn't have that option for our 6-week trip across the continent. We put one at the bottom of both of our suitcases, and one in our backpacks. These work great! We also felt peace of mind being able to track where our suitcases where in the airport. Airlines are particularly great at misplacing luggage, and when you are in a foreign country, you don't want to be panicked about discovering that your bag is \"perdido\" or \"perdu\" or \"persa\", and the agent is going on break. In case you don't know, that is \"lost\". lol\nThe way they work is that they broadcast a ping to other Apple devices around it. At least one of those Apple devices can then broadcast it to the Find My location service. So if there are no Apple devices around, the location will not update. Alternatively, if there are Apple devices around but no connection to the internet, the location will not update. We were in both of those circumstances in remote places on our travels. Once we got within internet range, they started updating again. Pretty ingenious, as long as there are people around with iPhones; which fortunately was our case.\nIt was just great to double-confirm that your bag also made it on the plane! Or sometimes European airlines randomly set a bunch of suitcases out in the open for anyone to come by and snag. This is great if it's a communal object like a bike or a ballpoint pen, but a little different when it has your clothes in it! So with the AirTags we could walk right to where our bags where, without freaking out that we don't speak the language, and why in the world is everyone suddenly on break when your airplane lands and it's time to retrieve your suitcase? Were they busy working when the planes were flying and there was no luggage around? How do I apply for that job?\nWhen we boarded for our Mediterranean cruise, we could track that the porters got our bags on board the ship. Peace of mind.\nAnd the AirTags are so small, they don't take up any room and easily slip into a pocket, or the bottom of the backpack. So if sticky fingers happened to walk off with my backpack, they would not easily find my AirTag broadcasting it's location. Peace of mind.\nWhen we took a later trip to Costa Rica, same thing. Peace of mind knowing that I can track exactly where my bags are.\nI've become obsessed with my AirTags and wish I would have found them sooner. I highly, highly recommend these. They have been worth every penny in the peace of mind I've found.",
            "In the past week, our golf cart and a wallet were stolen(2 separate events). We were able to track both the wallet and the golf cart and retrieve both of them. We tracked the wallet to the person's home and work. We went to their work and turned the air tag sound on to verify that they had it with them( it was in their car).\n\nWith the golf cart, we were able to follow the person right to their house and get it back.\n\nIt is easy to install and the location is spot on.\nWe have it for our bikes and dog, as well.\n\nThe air tag saved me thousands of dollars this week. It is truly an amazing",
            "I put 1 in each in my kids‚Äô cars and 1 in my car. 18 months later, all 4 died at the same time! I replaced the batteries and they just would not pair with iPhone again.\n\n(Resolved: Turn out there‚Äôs nothing wrong with network or iPhone. Just the AirTags need to be reset. To reset your AirTag, you need to physically remove and reinsert the battery 5 times. The first four times when you put the battery back, it makes a sound, the 5th time it will produce a different sound, and my iPhone detected it right away. This process resets the AirTag to its factory settings, allowing you to pair it with a new device.)",
            "I wasn‚Äôt sure what to rate it at firstü•π\nI think everybody knows about these things more than I did or I‚Äôm the last to know lol. I bought the four pack because I can make use guaranteed at least with three of them. If not the fourth one. When I first took it out of the box, I pulled the plastic tab so the battery starts to work and there was very loud chirp. So I was thinking good that‚Äôs going to make a good alarm. If I need to find it and have it play a sound. Everything is going well so far but then I want to see if I‚Äôm going to find it easy to replace the battery. I don‚Äôt know how long the battery will last. So screw the case which was easy and the battery came out and I looked at it carefully to see how it goes in and this is when the problems began. These must‚Äôve been on the shelf for a very long time, because I think the battery made one loud chirp, and that was the end of what it had because when I put the battery back in it could barely chirp. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt chirp, but it was very low, volume and very short. I thought it‚Äôs not making contact with the battery clips or something so I make sure everything is clean and it doesn‚Äôt do any better. Now I‚Äôm thinking this is not going to be very reliable, and therefore not useful. I know they‚Äôre not going into inventory and replacing batteries on things that they don‚Äôt sell in the first year and these look like they are made two years ago. Anyway, I put it aside out of my mind and I went to go get my hair done a couple of days later. I left that one AirTag in the house near my bathtub and I wasn‚Äôt using it even contemplating returning the whole thing including the cases I bought. I was worried that it was like the security cameras I bought that our wireless and I felt really good so I bought a lot of them for the house and then I found out they have a habit of occasionally going off-line and need to be restarted that drove me crazy, so I never deployed more than one of them, and this was feeling like it was going to be another product just like that. Anyway, I wasn‚Äôt sure of all the ways I‚Äôm supposed to work with the AirTags so I figure I‚Äôm going to buy a battery and try it again in the next couple of days and then decide on returning or not. Anyway, I‚Äôm leaving the house to go for my appointment and my phone gives me a warning that I‚Äôm leaving my purse behind! I was so thrilled I was sure the battery is depleted or the AirTag doesn‚Äôt work well but the combination wasn‚Äôt working and it did. It told me the signals are weak so at least that means it worked. On the way home I had it help me locate it, and literally it walked me to within , 6 feet or less of where the AirTag was so just like advertised! These work and they are fantastic. There are many things you can do with them depending on how you want to put them because you have to worry that if somebody sees it on your luggage, they just have to take it off your bag and run through the battery real quick and then your AirTag is history . It‚Äôs a lumpy thing to try to hide unless it‚Äôs something really big like your car and you have a lot of places to put it but then I wonder because the car is metal is it going to work. I think if you make an opening in the lining of your suitcase, or your purse or something else and put it there , and then set a reminder like within the year that all of them need to have new batteries, you‚Äôre going to be very happy with them!!\n\nI totally understand that these are all the rage, but I also understand that if somebody has this program on their iPhone, they can find your items as well and possibly take them or take the battery out of it and now it is their AirTag and you lost your item and your AirTag!!!üò°\n\nI totally recommend these for anybody that wants to have one more chance when you misplaced something important to you. It‚Äôs one more way before you say goodbye to something that‚Äôs important that you can have an opportunity to find it.",
            "Great value for the price. I bought the pack so I could use one on each of my dogs' collars as a back up to their chip and another for the keys I'm always misplacing. Great add with iphone so you can ding whatever you misplace all the time.",
            "I can track my kids! Hello? How else can you track a 13 year old who‚Äôs so private about their decides and locations, here‚Äôs how, add a tag to their keys.

The plug on my old surge protector stuck way out from the wall so the piece of furniture that I had in front of the wall outlet had to be pulled several inches away from the wall to accommodate the bulky plug. With this new surge protector, the plug that goes into the wall outlet is nice and flush which allows you to place any furniture in front of it much closer to the wall. I placed this behind a dresser that I have under my TV in my bedroom. I also used to have to plug my Roku device directly into the wall outlet because the cord was not long enough to reach my old power strip (the Roku also has a plug that sticks out several inches from the wall). But with the style of this power strip I am able to stand it on its side, this makes it just tall enough so that the Roku plugs into the outlet on the side of the surge protector. This means I can push my dresser closer to the wall than I previously was able to. It‚Äôs a very versatile surge protector and I would definitely buy this style again if and when I needed it elsewhere in the house.",
            "I ordered three. Two are fine but one cuts off and on. I couldn‚Äôt send it back because It started flickering after the return date",
            "I was curious and wanted to try this out for myself. I've always stuck to the basic extension cords that are long rectangle and only offer about 5 slots.\n\nThis one is super convenient because of size and how many plugs it offers. It has 8 standard electronic plugs, 2 usbc and 2 USB slots. It's rather sturdy and can extend pretty far. The wire itself is flexible. I use this in my room and one my outlets is behind a bookshelf and because of it's flat plug there was no hassle.",
            "Let me start by saying‚Äîthis TESSAN Ultra Thin Power Strip is the unsung hero of my home. I never knew how much I needed a flat plug until I found this. As someone who‚Äôs a little ‚Äúchunky‚Äù and a bit ‚Äúolder‚Äù than I once was, this thing is a lifesaver. The flat plug slides neatly behind furniture like it was born to do it, making me look like I have my life together.\n\nPros:\n\nFlat plug design: It‚Äôs like the power strip is on a diet‚Äîslim and sleek, fitting behind furniture without any complaints. No more awkwardly shoving plugs behind couches or tripping over cords!\n\n20-foot cord: I can now reach outlets without performing acrobatics or rearranging my whole living room. This is the freedom I never knew I had.\nUSB ports galore: 8 AC outlets and 3 USB ports (including a USB-C!)? It's like a charging station for every gadget I own, and let‚Äôs be honest, I own a lot. My devices are always powered up and happy.\n\nSurge protection: With 900J of surge protection, I feel like my electronics are getting VIP treatment. It's like a little armor for my devices.\n\nCons:\n\nWhere's the downside? Honestly, the only thing that could be a ‚Äúcon‚Äù is if you‚Äôre allergic to things that make your life easier. But even that‚Äôs a stretch.\n\nIn short, this power strip is like the superhero of home office gadgets, and I‚Äôm just over here in awe. It‚Äôs saved me from my chaotic wiring mess and brought order to my life, one outlet at a time. Highly recommend!",
            "I got this for my bathroom countertop because there's not enough power ports for all the crap I use in the bathroom. I have an electric toothbrush, a hairdryer, a mirror, a wax warmer, and a humidifier. Sometimes I charge up my stir mug. All of these item fit [minus the hairdryer] and no I do not use/power up all the items at once, two at a time max. I do like the various USB ports that is on one of it's sides. I also like that there's an toggle off and on switch with a light to tell you if it's off or not.\n\nI kinda of wish I got a cord organizer or that one came with but I'm fine. If you do get this item, invest in a cord organizer. Don't be like me and have regrets in not investing in one while buying this power strip.\n\nI can't give a full 5 stars because it doesn't wow me. But I would recommend this item.\n\nNOTE: Most standard hairdryers need to be plugged into the acutal power port into the wall of your home itself due to safety. Do not put it into this product.\n\nPro(s): Power switch. Small. Power on light. Multi-sided ports.\n\nCon(s): N/A",
            "This power block it one of my favorite upgrades it has enough plugs it's not to bulky and it even has charger ports for your phone it's just the right length so u get that extra with your phone cordslove the color it's easy to use self explaining really I brought two and my son took the other for his room to hookup all his gaming needs well worth my money",
            "I saw a detailed video on how this can be used. It can even be attached to the side rail of your bed which makes this super handy. I have wires all over the place for charging my electronics. This condenses everything in one place. Better organized, neat and safe.",
            "It's compact it's perfect for everything that we have plugged in and I don't have to worry about anything getting cluttered",

            "I've wanted a pair of Beats since the late 2000's but never had the money to get a pair. I wanted to finally try something new and on a whim, purchased these since they were on sale. I wanted to compare the quality to the AirPods that I've had for a few years now. I was very happy when I put these on and found that they were almost similar in sound quality. I still will have to give AirPod the better sound rating but these Beats are a very very close next. These do not have noise cancellation, however the fit of the cushions on the headphones are actually quite snug so it does help with blocking some noise out, all noise is gone when blasting music of course, but don't damage your ears doing this for long periods! As others have stated, the Cloud Pink is not \"pink\". It's more of a white with a deep hue. They are comfortable and do have a little bit of weight to them so they don't fall off as easily if you're bending down to grab something.",
            "Lifelong Studio and Solo Beats user. These are the most comfortable Solos I have owned. They don‚Äôt slide around or fall off like my Solo 3 s used to. They are pretty much the perfect tightness and seal on my ear. I prefer the outer ear coverage of the Solo. This Solo 4 version has softer foam on the ears and they moved the power light to the left ear. The Major Difference is the Type C Charger instead of the Micro USB. The Type C is much better. These Solo 4s sound louder than my 3s but not by much. They worked to connect on Bluetooth Steam on my PC. In the Game Rivals it would play normally on the different lobby screens. Once I entered a match the Audio would completely distort. Only while in matchmaking. While I‚Äôm Menu and the rest of Rivals it sounded normal. Could just be my PC. Just a heads up if you plan on gaming with these. Microphone did not work for Voice Chat in Steam.",
            "The Beats Solo 4 Wireless Headphones offer a sleek design and impressive battery life, lasting up to **50 hours** on a single charge. The **Personalized Spatial Audio** with dynamic head tracking enhances the listening experience, making music feel immersive . The **UltraPlush ear cushions** provide decent comfort, though some users may find the on-ear fit a bit tight over long periods.\nSound quality is solid, with **custom-built 40mm transducers** delivering clear highs and balanced bass, though it may not satisfy audiophiles looking for deep, rich tones. The addition of **USB-C and 3.5mm audio cable support** for high-resolution lossless audio is a great. Overall, the Beats Solo 4 are a stylish and reliable choice for casual listeners who prioritize battery life and convenience over premium sound quality.",
            "This was a gift for my niece and let me tell you she is obsessed with these headphones. First of all the color is great and the sound quality is amazing. I tried them on and heard a little bit of music and I was able to activate noise cancellation just like the AirPods these headphones made a perfect gift for her because she likes to go to the gym. I asked her if they wouldn‚Äôt fall off her head while she was running on the treadmill or working out and she said they stayed on her and didn‚Äôt sip off. The quality of the battery is amazing. She said that the headphones charged quick and the battery life last about three days.\n\nThe button makes it easier for her to work out and listen to music at the same time. After hearing all these good things and how excited she was, it was definitely worth the money that I paid.",
            "Received on time, open and pared without any issues. When i paired, i did receive a dialog box stating the this device was already registered to another account and that I had to transfer this device to my account. I pressed OK and no issues. For the price, im not worried they are under warranty by apple. Loved this purchase, great fit, amazing sound. Im happy",
            "I love these beats, huge upgrade from my AirPods! Like I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how much I love them. DEFINITELY worth the value for money seriously! Buttons work great! It one button on right side to turn it off and on, on the left side the outer circle controls the volume going up & down, the inner circle controls the microphone and hang up button on the phone. Pressing it once mutes, pressing it twice hangs up. Playing music same for the outer buttons aka the volume the inner button only pauses the music. The sound is perfect! No muffling or nothing! Durability I haven‚Äôt had them for too long maybe just 2 months but nothing wrong with them no cords hanging out no broken nothing! Ease of use, excellent! This is a very great purchase!",
            "I love listening to music and I like to tune everything out. I like the first pair of AirPods that came out because they were small and fixed perfectly with my ear piercings. But it gets annoyed when you‚Äôre working out, or changing and they keep falling out etc. They got dirty too fast and sometimes if you misplace them it‚Äôs hard to find them. So I opt to go back to beats. I decided to do the all black for a clean look and it‚Äôs one of my favorite colors. Anyways I ordered and they came the next day. Fast shipping and nice packing. When I opened the box the beats were charged which was cool so I can try them on right away. I have a three year old toddler who cries/ throws tantrums every other second. I can‚Äôt hear the cry when I‚Äôm listening to music. I can barely hear myself if I‚Äôm singing loudly. When I send voice notes then sound so clear and a bit loud depending on volume of your voice. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase would buy another pair!! Very secure on my head I can shake my head and not a slight of a move. Definitely good for the gym, running, cleaning and just to jam out. If outside I‚Äôll lower my volume or have one of my ears out to be able to hear because if not I won‚Äôt be aware of any of my surroundings lol.",
            "I'm a huge headphone collector always looking for good quality sets. A very long time ago I used to own the first beats generation whose quality was amazing... over time I started using other sets and brands like Sony, Bose, etc.. I have a lot of sets for particular purposes. Yes is right that these don't come with noise cancelling and that music doesn't stop when you take them off... but I was not looking for any high end/premium headphones, but instead something more simple, classic, that could deliver good sound quality. It is also true that its bass is not what it used to be, but this is to help to provide a better and more crisp sound. Apple indeed made a downgrade and I'm not a full fan of downgrading bass, but being able to use the spatial sound feature in these is great, it makes music much more enjoyable with clear vocals and you can actually distinguish instruments better than just having a full blast on the bass.\nAgain, I wasn't going for a noise cancelling set, and its \"passive\" noise cancelling is good enough (not for very loud places like airplanes though) but that's why I have other sets in case I want noise cancelling.\nThis stays on pretty well while working out and even though is not specified it does feel sweat resistance and they feel pretty comfortable.\n\nLove their size btw, small, compact enough to fit in a my already bulky backpack. It came with a very nice case/pack where I can fill with a few more stuff, so that's a big plus.\n\nNot sure other models, but I loved my blue ones.\n\nNow... even though they feel quite comfortable, not sure they would be in the long run... they get a little less comfortable after an hour of use or so, bringing a little pressure in your ears, particularly the right side near the charging port (something odd about it makes it uncomfortable). Cushion is not as stiff like other brands, but it's ok... not the best, but manageable.\n\nOverall I do give these a 5 star because of the price/quality value, their sound quality, durability, and how convenient this are.\n\nIs probably not a must buy, but I would buy them again.\n\nnote: My wife tried them and now she wants a pair too LOL, she loved them... So will buy another set just for her.",
            "Great choice, quality and color, use them at gym, when travelling or just to relax",
            "The noise cancelling is perfect and they're easy to travel with. The traveling case it comes with is small. My only small nitpick is that they aren't as pink as shown on the photo, and my charging cable doesn't match the color either. The cord is Grey which an odd color in this case. No problems at all otherwise. Highly recommend."

            "I reached out to TOZO following an issue with my T6 set of earbuds and they offered me a rebate on these, since my T6‚Äôs were out from under the warrantee and couldn‚Äôt be repaired. I loved my T6s; they lasted a long, long time and I was sad to give them up but I was willing to give these a try. Holy crap, these are amazing! They did everything the T6s did, but more and better. They also address some of the issues I had with the T6s - no disconnections and reconnections during phone calls, no erroneously varying tap sensitivity, no connections while in the charging case. These issues were minor and I was certainly willing to live with them given the quality of sound and ease of use of the T6 but I was very happy to see these corrected in newer models.\n\nThe NC9‚Äôs have three modes - normal, for a little external noise with no variation in sound frequency (for quiet environments), transparency, for allowing external sounds when situational awareness is necessitated (for keeping track of kids or pets or ensuring safety while working in an environment where you may need to respond to hazards or danger), and noise-cancelling (great for droning machinery and traffic). They come out of the charging case in normal mode and you can activate transparency with a single tap on the left, switch between transparency and noise cancelling with another single tap, and then a triple tap will take you back to normal mode, very competently designed by someone who understood that you may want to switch between modes quickly and easily for safety concerns. I‚Äôve had a chance to try all of these in different environments. Holding my hand out to the side and snapping my fingers (and I‚Äôm a loud snapper lol), the normal mode allows for a little sound to come through. The transparency mode boosts the treble of the sound, allowing me to discern both the type of sound and its direction. The noise cancelling reduces the sound to almost nothing. I use all three of these on walks at night - I live in a busy city with crazy drivers and with a single tap, I can activate transparency mode while at a crosswalk or walking down a dark alley to make sure no one is sneaking up on me (or running a red light), and then tap again for noise-cancelling once I‚Äôm in a safer area, and take it back to normal mode if I‚Äôm in a quieter location without danger. Same thing in the shower, where I‚Äôve usually got them in noise-cancelling - it‚Äôs very easy to tap if I think I‚Äôve heard a knock on the door or my rabbits causing trouble, just to make sure no one‚Äôs gonna come in and Psycho me. They also don‚Äôt seem to be affected by hot water, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about your shower adjusting your volume for you, which is great my shower has no idea how loud or soft I want my Pink Floyd. Transparency and noise-cancelling both maintain a very high sound quality, just with added features.\n\nThe NC9s are fantastic for both the music I listen to and videos I watch! They‚Äôre excellent with hard rock and rap, with vibrant bass and treble and clear dictation with vocals, and I love that they bring out instruments usually buried in the mixes of the classical music I enjoy, definitely better than your average earbud. Like, if the mixing is good, you‚Äôre gonna hear all sorts of stuff you may have missed before! If the mixing is bad, well, it was gonna sound not-so-good anyways, but now you‚Äôll be able to articulate why and what you‚Äôre missing, and it‚Äôll probably still sound a little better.\n\nWith podcasts or video essays, there is clear distinction between speech, music, and added clips in the sound and I‚Äôve learned so much about the creator‚Äôs whose content I enjoy! Who knew video essayists breathed so much? I mean obviously I guess people are always breathing but I‚Äôve just never noticed it before! I caught you!\n\nThe battery lasts quite a long time, accurate to the assessment on the product page. I‚Äôve been wearing them for long hours since I got them on last week and I haven‚Äôt needed to charge the case yet, which is another bonus on the T6, which I thought did a great job lasting but these can go quite a bit longer. I haven‚Äôt had them run low on battery yet, probably because I pop them in the case every time I take them off, but they also have an auto-shut-off if there‚Äôs no music playing so if you just set them down, they‚Äôre not going to run their batteries down. The interface with the exact battery percentage is also a plus - it keeps track of the charging case and an approximation of each individual earbud so you know when they‚Äôre ready to go, another plus from the T6 where you just kind of had to guess and hope they were actually charged and didn‚Äôt just jostle off the charger.\n\nThey‚Äôre very comfortable; they don‚Äôt press on my piercings (I have a daith and conch on one side and they fit perfectly fine and stay in place, I love that they vibe with my alternative, quirky-girly lifestyle lol) and they don‚Äôt bother my weirdly shaped ear canals haha I‚Äôve had so many issues with other in-ear headphones causing earaches and I gave these a workout the other day with 12 hours of wear and they felt just fine.\n\nTwo (very minor) drawbacks for some people:\n1. You have to tap pretty quickly to transition between modes and features. I don‚Äôt consider this much of an issue, since I have neurological issues and usually I have a problem with tapping too fast for earbuds to register or too many times for the features I want, it just took a day or so to get used to not having to adjust my tremble for my headphones. But on that note, kudos to whoever designed the user interactivity because they clearly had tap-errors (too many, too few, too quickly, too slowly) in mind. I mean that no error you make causes any trouble that you can‚Äôt fix with a few additional taps, so no power-offs or disconnections or activating a feature far different than the one you meant. For example, to answer a phone call, it‚Äôs one tap on the left or right, but to dismiss a phone call, you have to hold for a whole 2 seconds, meaning it‚Äôs very unlikely you‚Äôre going to accidentally hang up. To raise or lower the volume, it‚Äôs hold for 2 seconds on the right or left respectively, but if you tap for a little less than 2 seconds, you‚Äôll just activate transparency/noise-cancelling on the left (1 or 3 taps to fix) or pause the sound on the right (1 tap to fix). It‚Äôs not gonna skip around (next - 2 taps, right; previous - 2 taps, left) or activate voice assistance (3 taps, right), or disconnect or power them off. Very intuitive! Any mistake you make is related to what you meant to do, and easily fixable! There aren‚Äôt too many instructions to memorize, which is great because I have a tiny brain! :D\n2. The sounds quality is kind of intense, so if you‚Äôre sensitive to crisp or rich tones, maybe start a little quieter like I had to. I definitely have some sort of auditory processing troubles, like, sometimes sounds become garbled or sharp or buzzy or shrill or fade into the void without me realizing, so suddenly hearing my favorite streamer‚Äôs keyboard go clack-clack-clackity-clack when I‚Äôd never heard it before was almost a little spooky! Like, when I say you‚Äôll hear seemingly EVERYTHING, I mean it! For most people, including the couple I let try these out, that‚Äôs a huge bonus - they‚Äôre big music and podcast people and loved all the additional sounds that felt closer to them than ever. (Also they do not have any APD, so hearing a quiet breath or keyboard clack didn‚Äôt bother them at all, so in all honesty, that might just be a me thing) But for the first few hours of wearing them, it was a little overwhelming for me! After I got used to it though, I really appreciate the quality. It‚Äôs made listening to my favorite pieces a joy all over again, and I‚Äôm really glad I stuck with them! I love hearing every piccolo squeal and bassoon honk on the tracks now, and with the sounds being more clear, I‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôre not fading into the background as much as with my old headphones, when I could go almost an hour forgetting I‚Äôm even listening to something until it ends. All that to say, if you‚Äôre used to a more muted, blended experience, prepare to have your mind blown (and maybe turn the volume down just a tad for your first few hours, that worked for me at least :) )\n\nAnd that‚Äôs it! Yeah, these are awesome! Thank you so much TOZO! I feel so much cooler with my fancy new earbuds, and I hope anyone reading this loves them as much as I do! Best in-ear earphones ever!",
            "Third pair of Tozo's and the best so far.\n\nI have liked the Tozo earbuds I have used. I can't compare them to very expensive brands but if those high dollar brands are truly worth the money you pay then they must be insanely great, because all the Tozo's I have had, have had great sound and very nice Noise Cancellation. These NC9 Model's are a huge step up on the older Tozo's I have had that I considered to be great. I have an old 25 year old ford ranger that generates a lot of road noise and interior noise from AC/Fans etc.. engine noise.. Just lots of old car noise. I can turn the noise cancellation on and 90% of it goes away.. It feels like noise wise I sat down in a newer quieter car. Just amazing.. also people I'm on the phone with report that the can not hear the background noise and that my voice is nice and clear. The 6 microphones built in do a good job of capturing my voice and at the same time filtering out external white noise both for me and the people on the other end of my call. My older Tozo's didn't seem to filter the noise for the people I was talking to before so I think this is a new feature. I would say that the NC on these new units is at least 30% better than the old ones. This is just my guess. We have quite window units in our house for AC. The old earbuds would reduce the noise to almost not noticeable. The new ones reduce it to where you can't tell the AC units or any fans or motors in the house are running. When I first tried them I kept thinking the AC had been turned off.\n\nbattery life is decent. I think I am getting the full advertised usage, however I don't normally use them that much in a single go or even in a couple days so I tend to run them down to no more than 30 to 40% at the most and then put back in the case to charge back up. If I have used them that day I put the case on the charger on the bedside in the evening so I don't think I have ever run the case down more than 25%.\n\nI have used 3 pairs of Tozo's so far. And my wife and daughter have each been given a pair and they are really happy with them. I did buy one pair that I returned as it had a permanent white noise in one earbud that I couldn't get rid of. Factory reset etc.. didn't help so I immediately returned. I just considered that a quality control issue and to be honest it wasn't loud nor made it unusable but it was annoying. Over all though the price to performance and reliability have made me really happy.\n\nI have no issues recommending these. They only advice is to purchase whichever model has the newest tech in it if you can afford it. There is significant improvements in the newer more feature rich models. That being said I thought the older models were the cat's meow at the time and loved them. Still would be happy with them in the absence of the new models. the older models are now in the 19 to 22 dollar range on average with the new ones being in the 39 to 59 dollar range. Each of the new ones I have purchase though have had coupons or discounts putting them in the 29 dollar range. Pricing is always a time sensitive then so this is only valid for when this review was made.\n\nMy biggest complaint has nothing to do with Tozo or any brand but with earbuds in general. They are small, both bud's and case's and easy to lose or misplace. It drives me nut's trying to keep track of them sometimes. However that is a me problem and not anything to do with any fault with the actual product.",
            "I like TOZO as a brand and actually have several of their ear buds. I work alone self employed and use my earphones for around 10 hours a day.\n\nNot just for music and podcasts and radio. I make and receive work related calls for a fair part of the working day. I need calls to be clear for me and the caller.\n\nSo with that in mind, this set of buds tick all the boxes.\n\nThe sound is crisp and clear. Music sounds really really good with a great balance of bass and treble and mid tones. The controls are simple and just work.\n\nThe battery lasts hours, the case is neat in the pocket, doesn‚Äôt take long to charge and the visual battery display is easy to read at a glance without having to open the case.\n\nTo summarise, if you‚Äôre looking to buy some ear buds that give you everything at a great price, you can‚Äôt go wrong with these.",
            "Apr√®s avoir essay√© plusieurs sortes et √©tant donn√© que j‚Äôai certaines exigences au niveau du son je confirme que ces oreillettes sont de loin les meilleurs que j‚Äôai √©cout√© de plus le logiciel fourni avec est au top .\nVous pouvez les acheter les yeux ferm√©s, super rapport qualit√© prix\nBonne √©coute √† vous",
            "Audio quality is very usable - better than most other cheap earbuds and headphones, and almost as good as equivalent models from Soundpeats and Anker, but remember those cost twice as much for only about 10% better audio. They won't impress audiophiles, but they have a fairly clean, almost flat sound - bass is a little lacking, but still not bad overall.\n\nThe ANC is some of the best I've ever heard. Almost no audible hiss, and I can barely hear a sewing machine or vacuum cleaner only a couple of metres away, even with music at a low volume. I can still hear some noise without anything playing, but I was genuinely surprised at how cleanly it reduce noise, especially compared with other budget ANC earbuds. Passthrough is also extremely clear.\n\nMic quality is decent, nice and loud, no problems with clarity or being understood. Suffers a bit in windy environments, but again, much better than other cheap earbuds.\n\nComfort isn't perfect, but it's remarkably good, even for fairly long sessions. They stay in for hours, even if they do eventually work themselves loose enough to break the seal.\n\nBattery life is excellent - I've gone 10 hours straight (with ANC off) and they didn't even give a low battery warning. They also charge really quickly in the case, which also has plenty of juice.\n\nControls are a little different to some other brands, but still quite intuitive and very responsive. No regrets at all at this price.\n\nAlso, worth noting is that there's probably very little quality control. After a couple of months, the left earbud was suddenly much quieter than the right. Re-pairing, re-setting, cleaning, etc had no effect, but the Tozo support was very prompt, very helpful (not just canned responses) and they replaced them quickly without making me jump through hoops",
            "I take a chance to buy something cheaper than I normally use/used, and for me the call quality is important because of noisy enviroments grinders, engines and so on, so pickong up a call and not escape the present is of great importance - believe it or not but these ones do the job better than Samsung bud 2pro or iphone airbuds pro not mayby as good as 3M WS But they are big and the mic almost in you're mouth, so this is freedom and the music experiense is fine to app fine.\nFor this price range never test anything close to what they deliver.",
            "Great. Good noise reduction, great sound quality and battery life.\n\nHate to say it - better than Samsung buds pro for practically nothing."

            "Original review (two updates below - TL/DR, these are phenomenal for the price, along with Anker customer service!):\n\nOk, first of all, I don't buy expensive earbuds. Never have, never will. I like good sounding music but I'm not an audiophile, I have kids and dogs, I travel for work occasionally, things get lost, etc. I've been using Boltune BT-BH020's for the last several years with a lot of success. Good sound quality, nice little magnetic case, USB-C charging, etc. My wife and I both have 2 pairs each, and they were about $35 a pair the last time we bought some. One pair finally crapped out on me so I went to order another set, and unfortunately they no longer exist. Not surprising considering the lifespan of cheaper Chinese brands on Amazon, but I was still a little disappointed.\n\nI liked the form factor of the Boltune case so I started looking for similar options, and landed on the Anker Soundcore P20i. I have always had good luck with Anker chargers and accessories in the past, so I was expecting a good, simple set of earbuds for $20, but nothing fancy. I tell you what though, I'm pretty blown away with what you get with these - easily the best \"budget\" level earbuds I've ever used.\n\nPackaging is typical Anker - excellent. Well put together, well protected. The earbud case itself is just slightly smaller than my old Boltune cases, but it comes with an attached lanyard, and has a notched area in the front for ease of opening - something that Boltune never got quite right (opening those cases was always a PITA, especially in the dark). Operation is simple - open the case and the earbuds power on (they will automatically go into device pairing mode if they haven't been paired yet). Return the earbuds to the case and close it to power them down and recharge. A couple additional sets of different sized earbud inserts are included so you can find the size that works best for your ears, as well as a 6\" USB-C charging cable and a well written instruction manual. Of note, Anker placed plastic covers over the charging prongs to keep them from being damaged in shipping or powering on accidentally and draining the batteries - a nice touch. The case battery was almost fully charged upon arrival and only took about 10 minutes to top off, and the earbuds showed 100% via the app right out of the box (more on the app in a second).\n\nOnce paired, the sound quality is fantastic, especially at this price point. They easily outperform my other earbuds, especially in the low end. Mids and highs are crisp without being screechy or piercing. I can't really comment on bluetooth range as my phone is usually in my pocket while I'm mowing the lawn or working in the garage, so I've never really needed to test that aspect. Battery life is advertised as 10 hours on the earbuds alone without charging them at all, and 30 hours if you return them to the case to recharge between uses. I haven't had to recharge the case yet so I can't confirm that, but I have no reason to doubt that they'll work as advertised. They also say that ten minutes of charging will get you 2 hours of listening time, so these thing would be great for the airport even if you forgot to charge them beforehand and only have a few minutes between flights.\n\nWhat really sets these things apart though? The app! It is well designed, obviously created by native English-speaking developers, and is simple and intuitive to use. The first time I synced the earbuds to the app, I got an alert for a firmware update! I've NEVER had a cheap pair of earbuds that had that kind of support from the manufacturer - really awesome to see. Going beyond that, you can see the battery level for each earbud, configure the sound profile you prefer, turn on a bass boost if that's your thing, you can configure the left and right touchpads on the earbuds to do the function of your choice (answer, hang up, go forward one track, go back one track, etc) - and there's even a device locator that will play a loud high-pitched beep through the earbud of your choice if you accidentally drop one and can't find it. That feature alone is worth it's weight in gold - I can't tell you how many times I've dropped an earbud off of my nightstand and had to root around looking for the stupid thing, lol.\n\nAll in all, I'm really impressed with these for the money. Hands down the best earbuds I've ever owned, and they are the cheapest so far! Well done, Anker!\n\nAlso - I'm not a bot, not a shill, and nobody paid me to say this. Just a happy, human customer who's impressed with the product!\n\nUpdate 9/12/2024: Stellar customer service from Anker! If I could upgrade my review from 5 stars to 10, I would!\n\nSo, randomly yesterday I was using my earbuds watching YouTube like I always do, and got a low battery notification. Plugged the case in and put the earbuds away to charge, and decided to get in the shower while they charged up. Came back out to resume watching my show, and for some reason only one earbud connected. Messed around with them for a while trying to get the second one to connect, and even though they both were powered on, I couldn't for the life of me get them to connect at the same time. I checked the paired device list on my phone and ended up noticing that each earbud was showing up as it's own individual device on my Bluetooth list, so my phone would only connect to one at a time. I couldn't get them to reset, unpairing and re-pairing made no difference, restarting my phone made no difference...something was wrong.\n\nI emailed Anker customer service, filled out the form on their website and provided a screenshot of my Amazon order, the order number, and the device serial number on the back of the case. They suggested some things to try (all of which I had already done), and when none of that worked, they apologized for the problems and agreed to replace my earbuds 100% free of charge! The rep said I should have a new pair within 5 business days. I got a shipping confirmation this morning...and guys, I had brand new set of earbuds this afternoon! Less than 24 hours after filing a ticket, they had replacements in my hands. That is absolutely STELLAR customer service for a $20 pair of earbuds! Now read the original review below, and order these with confidence. It's unfortunate that mine had such a random and wonky issue, but trust that Anker will take care of you if necessary. Thanks for reading!\n\nUpdate #2, 2/19/2025: Replacement pair is still going strong 9 months later! Zero issues at all, same amazing sound quality, zero degredation in audio or battery life. My wife actually texted me and said that she was trying to figure out what happened to Boltune, and came across a Reddit post mentioning this review! Thanks for mentioning me AmazingGrace911, cool to see that so many people agree! :) The price has gone up by about $5, but these are still 100% worth every penny!",
            "I‚Äôve been using the Soundcore P20i earbuds for about a week now, and honestly, I‚Äôm really impressed with what Anker delivered at this price point. These aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúcheap‚Äù earbuds, they‚Äôre genuinely reliable for daily life. Here is my initial thoughts about the wireless earbuds broken down:\n\nDaily use and sound quality:\nI mostly use them during my morning commute and while working at my desk. The sound profile is definitely bass-forward, which I actually enjoy for podcasts and music with a beat. That said, I used the Soundcore app to tweak the EQ settings, there are 20+ presets, and I found a great balance for vocals and acoustic tracks too. Even with the bass boost, it doesn‚Äôt drown everything else out.\n\nComfort, fit:\nThey stay in place really well. I‚Äôve taken them on 2 mile walks and used them during light workouts and never had to adjust them once. The default medium tips fit my ears perfectly, but they come with small and large ones just in case. After an hour or more of wear, they‚Äôre still comfortable, no ear fatigue like I‚Äôve had with some others.\n\nBattery life:\nBattery is solid. I typically charge the case once every 5‚Äì6 days with moderate use (maybe 2‚Äì3 hours a day). The buds themselves hold about 10 hours of juice, and the case adds another 20. A 10-minute top-up has actually saved me a couple of times when I was heading out and realized I forgot to charge them.\n\nCalls and connectivity:\nI‚Äôve taken a few work calls with them and the mic quality is decent, no one‚Äôs complained, even when I was walking outside. Bluetooth pairing was easy, although switching between devices isn‚Äôt as seamless as Apple‚Äôs AirPods. You‚Äôll need to ‚Äúforget‚Äù the device and re-pair manually if you move between phone and laptop. It‚Äôs a minor hassle, but for the price, I can‚Äôt complain.\n\nBonus features:\nI didn‚Äôt expect the app to be this good. You can remap the touch controls, activate gaming mode (which cuts down on audio delay. I tested it watching Netflix and YouTube, and it helped), and even use ‚ÄúFind My Earbuds‚Äù if you misplace one.\n\nCons:\nThere‚Äôs no active noise cancellation, so don‚Äôt expect to block out everything in noisy environments. But the passive isolation is enough to drown out most office chatter or ambient noise. Also, if you're super picky about multi-device connectivity, you might get frustrated.\n\nFinal verdict:\nThese earbuds are my go to now. I‚Äôve got more expensive pairs, but for daily use, commutes, work, quick workouts, and even winding down with a podcast before bed, the P20i delivers. They‚Äôre affordable, easy to use, and surprisingly versatile. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy them again or recommend them to a friend.",
            "I‚Äôm honestly impressed. These are not just your average cheap wireless earbuds ‚Äì they actually deliver. The sound quality and bass are amazing, especially considering they‚Äôre under $30. I‚Äôve tried JLab, Skullcandy, all those go-to brands, and while they used to hit back in the day (especially the wired ones like the Skullcandy Ink‚Äôd or those JVC Marshmallows from like 2009‚Äì2010), the newer wireless budget options just haven‚Äôt been cutting it for me‚Ä¶ until now.\n\nThese earbuds brought me right back to that punchy, deep-bass sound I remember. The loudness is crisp without being sharp, and the bass has that satisfying oomph that‚Äôs rare in budget earbuds. I even compared them to my Beats Fit Pro ($200 earbuds), and while nothing is topping those, these came in a strong second.\n\nIf you‚Äôre picky like me and tired of wasting money on flat-sounding wireless buds, these are a steal. Trust me, they‚Äôre the real deal for the price.\n\nThe bass, loudness, and overall quality makes these a winner for budget earbuds",

            "Lite enklare och billiga h√∂rlurar som jag tycker har helt godk√§nt ljud i den prisklassen. Jag √§r ju l√•ngt ifr√•n en audiofil men jag √§r n√∂jd med dom.",
            "[Intro]\nUn po‚Äô stufo degli auricolari a filo, mi sono messo alla ricerca di un paio di cuffie bluetooth pratiche per l'uso quotidiano, senza dover spendere cifre esagerate per modelli super costosi e impegnativi. Con il catalogo Amazon cos√¨ vasto e ricco di opzioni, la scelta non √® stata semplice. Mi sono per√≤ imbattuto, quasi per caso, nelle Soundcore P20i di Anker e, avendo gi√† acquistato in passato altri prodotti di questo marchio come cassa audio bluetooth e power bank, conoscevo bene la loro qualit√† affidabile e quindi sono passato all'acquisto. Dopo averle utilizzate per diversi giorni, posso confermare di aver trovato esattamente quello che cercavo: un prodotto pratico, funzionale e dal costo contenuto che non delude affatto nelle prestazioni. Anker si conferma ancora una volta un brand capace di offrire ottima qualit√† senza far spendere una fortuna.\n\n[Caratteristiche tecniche e design]\nNon voglio dilungarmi troppo sulle specifiche tecniche, dato che queste informazioni sono gi√† ampiamente disponibili nella descrizione del prodotto. Ci√≤ che posso dire √® che il design √® minimal ma molto elegante. Gli auricolari sono compatti e leggeri, con un'estetica moderna e una semplicit√† d'uso a portata di tutti.\n\n[Funzionalit√† e utilizzo]\nQuello che mi √® piaciuto √® la possibilit√† di personalizzare l'audio tramite l'applicazione dedicata. L'app √® intuitiva e permette di regolare l'equalizzazione secondo le proprie preferenze. Sempre dalla app √® possibile personalizzare il tocco sulle cuffie per modificare i controlli, adattandoli alle proprie abitudini d'uso. La connessione Bluetooth √® stabile e veloce, e l'ingresso Type-C per la ricarica √® un grande plus che le rende compatibili con la maggior parte dei caricatori moderni! Ultimo ma non meno importante il cavo √® incluso nella confezione.\n\n[Esperienza d'uso]\nL'audio √® semplicemente spettacolare, soprattutto considerando la fascia di prezzo. I bassi sono profondi, gli alti cristallini e i medi ben bilanciati. Sono comodissime da indossare anche per lunghi periodi e l'isolamento acustico √® molto buono (Non avendo per√≤ altri confronti magari esistono prodotti molto migliori che con l‚Äôaudio ti portano su un altro pianeta üòä). La chiamata √® nitida e l'interlocutore mi sente perfettamente anche in ambienti rumorosi. Nell‚Äôorecchio non si muovono e nella confezione ci sono tre differenti misure di gommini in silicone, permettendo di adattarle perfettamente a qualsiasi conformazione dell'orecchio per un comfort ottimale. La pulizia risulta particolarmente semplice, a differenza di altri auricolari dotati di una \"retina\" protettiva, questi P20i presentano un'apertura diretta per l'uscita dell'audio che impedisce l'accumulo di sporco, rendendo la manutenzione quotidiana molto pi√π agevole.\n\n[Qualit√† dei materiali e durata nel tempo]\nIl packaging √® minimal ma ben fatto e completo di tutto il necessario. Il manuale chiaro e semplice. La costruzione in generale √® solida e i materiali sembrano di buona qualit√†. La custodia di ricarica con laccetto √® molto pratica e comoda, permettendo di trasportare gli auricolari in sicurezza ovunque. Mi √® piaciuto molto il posizionamento degli auricolari nella custodia: pratico, veloce e funzionale.\n\n[Rapporto qualit√†-prezzo]\nConsiderando le prestazioni audio, la comodit√†, la durata della batteria e tutte le funzionalit√† offerte, il rapporto qualit√†-prezzo √® eccezionale. Difficile trovare di meglio in questa fascia di mercato."

            "I own two of these monitors, I have been very happy with them. I carry them in my backpack/laptop case with all of my needed accessories, and it just simply works.\n\nI work from home and I was looking for something that I could take with me when I travel. My typical home setup involves a 43\" LG monitor in the center, and then four additional 1080P monitors. When I am on the road, I need something smaller to have more \"real estate\" to work with. I usually use a hotel 4k TV or 4k tv at the air BNB we stay at so that I don't have to the 43\" LG, but sometimes I just use these two portable screens. I have held meetings from a roadside park from the back of my Suburban with these while we were camping, from Panera while mixing audio, from a waiting room at an office while waiting on someone to complete their day, etc. All in all, the two that I have allow me to streamline my workflow when travelling. I have multiple windows up during the workday; I gather information from those screens and consolidate/copy/paste/ reference the data on my main laptop screen in the front and center. These monitors simply allow me to replicate what I have at home, but on a smaller and (somewhat) lighter scale.\n\nThe good: I am not a gamer, so I cannot comment on how these would work in a gaming setup, I work on documents and reporting. With that said, these have great color at a great size. I can fit my Macbook Pro, and up to four of these screens in my bag, plus all my accessories, including Jabra Engage 75 headset, Plantronics headset (backup) , Apple keyboard and mouse, StreamDeck, USB-C Hub, and when needed, a universal Docking station that uses DisplayLink technology (Dell UD22) to get the extra screens. Without that, the Mac won't support more than 3 or 4 displays (Check specs for your PC/Mac). I like that these are USB-C *AND* HDMI. I can use them on pretty much any modern PC. To use the HDMI, however, You do need to power the monitor over USB-C with the provided cable. That's not a product issue, it's simply because that's the way HDMI works, there is no power over the cable. VESA capable, which is a big plus, I have magnetic VESA arms and I leave the plates on these monitors so I can use them anywhere.\n\nThe bad: The rotator dial on the side has a tendency to get smashed in, but I don't use audio on either of the screens. I have a Bluetooth noise cancelling over the hear headphone set for that. A more solid design would have been with tactile push buttons instead of the rotator dial. I only have this problem with one of the screens. When I put them the backpack, I now put them in with the rotator dial pointed up to ensure a drop of the bag doesn't chance damaging the equipment.\n\nThe ugly: The weight of the screens and associated covers adds about 2.5 lbs each, which is a lot. I have ordered two more, so that will be 10 lbs in the laptop backpack. May need to switch to a roller bag to cart this entourage around.\n\nOnce I get the other two, I will revise this review. Right now I don't know if I will have to use the UD22 to utilize all of these screens simultaneously.",
            "It is key to know what you want this for. I'm not a gamer so this review is only from perspective of someone who works on documents all day, logged into an office remotely. So I needed a portable 2nd monitor for when I travel with macbook M1 Air. Must have read 100 reviews and looked at dozens of youtube videos and ultimately concluded for my use case, I did not need 4K, too expensive and unnecessary; and I do not need high refresh rate, but i did want high nits (brightness). Have tested it out only for a short while and so far, subject to any update I will make to this review, here's the good and the one not so terrible \"knock\":\n\nTHE GOOD:\nFor my use case, the 60 hertz refresh rate is totally fine. No doubt not ideal for a gamer; if gaming is your need I would look for one that has higher refresh rate of course.\nThe 1080P is wonderfully sharp - seems like it's better resolution than 1080P but probably just because the screen size is 15.6\" so pixel density is still good.\nIt came with several seemingly very good quality cables and a simple charger plug. Charger plug is USB A so it's not giving tremendous current but evidently it's fine. It also came with USB A to USB C cable for this charger plug to power the thing. It also came with a very nice USB C to USB C cable that plugs into one of the two (2) USB C ports (one under the other) on the left side and the other end plugs into USB C on Mac and it instantly just recognized the video stream and showed it, mirroring my Mac. Mac then lets you select to use it as an extended display. Both USB C ports on left side are labeled as USB C with a lightning bolt. I suspect this means both support the video stream and power into the device; I randomly picked one for the video connection and one for the power connection and it worked find; I suspect this means it doesn't matter which. I read on-line in specs that these USB C ports were on different sides, and only one supported video; this one is configured a little differently and perhaps just slightly updated since they wrote out their specs. NOTE - the USB A charging plug got very warm and the metal of the USB A plug was HOT when I unplugged it - I'm thinking I'm going to plug it in for power to a USB C charger to USB C port on device and see if that gives it the power it needs without heating up; will see... maybe but don't want to give it too much current and cause a problem; will think on that. UPDATE: have now used little anker usb c 20 watt charger plug with usb c to usb c for power and that worked fine and the metal usb plug at the charger did not get hot.\nI tested the two speakers on this monitor, having the Mac choose those speakers (all going through the one USB C cable) and the speakers are fine, just not as good as the speakers on the Mac (not really giving base but otherwise clear and sharp with OK volume). But who cares for this use case.\nIt ALSO came with another seemingly very solid, not cheap, cable that has HDMI MINI on one side, and standard HDMI on the other. I have a USB C to HDMI (standard sized) adapter so I will try that out as well but haven't yet. Left side of the device has the HDMI mini female port for this connection. UPDATE: have now tested the HDMI cable - works fine, zero issues.\nOver my enterprise level (CITRIX) connection there were zero issues with recognition of the second screen so, voila, remote working with 2 monitors (Mac screen and this second screen).\nThe thing has a bit of heft/weight to it but not terrible; maybe a pound and a half in weight. Feels fairly solidly built, not cheap.\nRight side has a power on switch and a little \"rocker\" wheel like the old school volume controls on side of transistor radios; when the monitor came on, I turned the rocker wheel up and it increased brightness to highest level. To me that's a nice direct mechanical capability to up the brightness without having to dig into settings. Naturally I put it to highest level of brightness. But, see below on this topic.\nUPDATE: have now also plugged it into iPad (Air 5th gen w/ usb c) and it also works perfectly both to mirror iPad or do center stage allowing a couple windows open on the extended display. Rather awesome.\nFinally it comes with a detachable thin case that wraps around it, covering screen when closed; and folded back using magnetic attachment to back of display, it stands at a couple different angles, similar to typical tablet covers that fold around, like on the iPad. Worked just fine.\n\nTHE ONE SMALLER \"KNOCK\" AND A NIT:\nBrightness: OK so one of my hoped for criteria was high NITS; I'm not so young and wanted a bright screen. Mac M1 Air gives 400 nits; my older Mac used to give 500 nits I believe and to older eyes, BRIGHT display is really helpful. In all my reading of reviews nearly ALL of the lower cost 1080P monitors from companies with unfamiliar brand names said they did 250 nits of brightness but this one said 400. I figured, probably not true but on a black Friday sale at $79 I figured, how could I possibly really go wrong? Well, it came, and it seems pretty close to the Mac display on brightness - huge relief. Then looking at the paperwork that comes with it, it is acknowledged as only 250 cd/m2; and yet, to my surprise, it seems plenty bright and acceptable for my needs. I would NOT think it's worth it to spend another $150 for a display that purports to give 4K as those are the ones that seem to promise more nits.\n\nOVERALL I say for the price point, for the sharpness, for the ease of set up, for the cables it comes with, for the ease of use, for the seemingly solid feel to it all, and for a buyer looking for a VERY affordable option for a second \"travel\" display to bring with a laptop - I find it difficult to believe ANYONE could knock this thing or say it is not well worth it and quite good.

            "I recently purchased the [Brand Name] Portable Monitor, and I must say it has exceeded all my expectations. This monitor has truly been a game changer for both work and entertainment purposes. Let me share my experience and why I highly recommend it.\n\nFirst and foremost, the portability factor is fantastic. The monitor is incredibly lightweight and slim, making it effortless to carry around wherever I go. It easily fits into my backpack without adding any significant weight. Whether I'm working at a coffee shop, traveling, or visiting a friend, I always have a high-quality display at my disposal.\n\nThe display quality is simply outstanding. The [Brand Name] Portable Monitor features a Full HD resolution, and the colors are vibrant and accurate. The viewing angles are excellent, allowing for a clear picture from any position. I use it for both work and entertainment purposes, and it never fails to deliver a visually pleasing experience. Whether I'm editing photos or watching movies, the sharpness and clarity are remarkable.\n\nSetting up the monitor is a breeze. It's compatible with various devices, including laptops, smartphones, and gaming consoles. I appreciate the flexibility it offers, as I can easily connect it via HDMI or USB-C. It even supports touchscreen functionality, which is incredibly useful when I'm working on the go or playing touchscreen-based games.\n\nAnother aspect that impressed me is the built-in speakers. Although they might not replace dedicated speakers, they deliver surprisingly decent audio quality. It's convenient for casual listening or when I'm watching videos without headphones. Of course, for a more immersive experience, I still prefer using external speakers or headphones.\n\nThe monitor also comes with a protective case, which is a thoughtful addition. It safeguards the screen from scratches and minor bumps, ensuring its longevity. The case is well-designed and provides easy access to ports and buttons without the need to remove it.\n\nLastly, I want to mention the durability of this portable monitor. Despite its slim design, it feels sturdy and well-built. I have been using it for a few months now, and it has withstood the test of time. It's evident that the [Brand Name] prioritizes quality, and it shows in every aspect of this product.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the [Brand Name] Portable Monitor. It has become an essential part of my work routine and a reliable source of entertainment on the go. If you're looking for a top-notch portable monitor with excellent display quality, versatility, and durability, look no further. This monitor is worth every penny, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a portable display solution.",
            "Sin duda es un gran producto a adquirir, si no tienes un espacio o si necesitas un monitor adicional en alg√∫n lugar que no cuentes con el mismo, es una gran ayuda, el calidad de imagen es excelente y la garant√≠a ofrecida por la f√°brica es muy buena (en el texto) y espero no tener que recurrir a ello en el futuro y de ser as√≠, espero tener ese respaldo de garant√≠a del fabricante."

            "The Apple AirTag is a compact, coin-shaped Bluetooth tracker designed to help you locate everyday items like keys, wallets, or bags using Apple‚Äôs Find My app. Measuring 31.9mm in diameter, 8mm thick, and weighing just 11g, it‚Äôs easy to attach to your belongings with optional accessories (sold separately). Powered by a replaceable CR2032 battery lasting about a year, it‚Äôs IP67 water- and dust-resistant, handling splashes or brief submersion. Setup is a breeze‚Äîtap to pair with an iPhone or iPad (iOS 14.5+), name your AirTag, and track it via the app. Precision Finding with Ultra-Wideband (UWB) tech (iPhone 11 or later, excluding SE/16e) guides you to nearby items with directional cues, while the Find My network leverages millions of Apple devices for global tracking. Lost Mode sends notifications when found, and NFC allows finders to access your contact info. Users love its accuracy, with one saying, ‚ÄúFound my keys under the couch in seconds.‚Äù Priced at $29 (single) or $99 (4-pack), it supports free engraving for personalization.\n\nStandouts: The UWB-enabled Precision Finding is a game-changer for close-range searches, and the vast Find My network ensures reliable tracking. The built-in speaker plays a sound to locate nearby AirTags, and anti-stalking features alert you to unauthorized trackers. Sharing with up to five people is handy for shared items.\nDownsides: No built-in attachment hole means extra cost for holders ($10-$35). It‚Äôs iOS-only, limiting Android compatibility, and the battery isn‚Äôt rechargeable. Some users note occasional connectivity delays in sparse areas, and the glossy finish scratches easily.\n\nFinal Thoughts: The Apple AirTag is a top-tier tracker for iOS users, offering unmatched precision and network reliability. The accessory cost and iOS exclusivity are drawbacks, but its seamless integration shines. I‚Äôd rate it a 4.5/5‚Äîexcellent for Apple ecosystems, less versatile otherwise. Buy from Amazon, Apple.com, or Best Buy for authenticity, and pair with a TagVault Surface for secure mounting.",
            "After losing a cochlear implant processor that was in its case ($10,200 loss), I needed a way that could track it. Now all my processor cases, my backpack, my keys, my suitcase, and even some of my smaller electronics are attached to one of these. These things are small, and unlike Tile(R) they are not dependent upon someone having the app. I love how my phone notifies me that I've left it behind. It gives me security that I will not lose another processor, and that I'll always know where my backpack is.\n\nI bought some keychain holders for these (another review) that didn't work as I'd hoped. I was able to locate the AirTag and reclaim each time. It helps that you can make it chime from your phone. They are definitely worth it! And the design allows the batteries to be replaced, so you can keep them up to date and not have to go purchase another one.",
            "Well sounds like they where expecting a miracle tracking device or at least a cellular/GPS type tracker if that's the scenario used to test it I just today, And I've tried many others tile, xyo, Samsung cellular tracker, and also i have a T-Mobile cell/GPS tracker, am now officially a true believer in the apple tag and this comes from one who has been an anti apple all apple no matter its purpose person for decades . Well they won I know have a iPhone 14 as well and asap ill be grabbing more tags for whatever i might or need to put them on. I have a very expensive electric bike I have done extensive work on for personal reasons well i always though i needed the Cell/GPS tracker if it was ever taken not an apple tag but I put both on it within less than an hour i found the cell tracker on the side of the road still tracking but not what i needed. The apple tag it still on it in fact drove across town following it today and pretty sure the guys he tried to sell it to either didn't or got refunded because I'm pretty sure i talked to them with their bs threats on police which i said awesome since we were literally across the street from city hall and this is true I told him well you can call them back and try to get them to hurry because ide love to talk to them to i had already tried finding one by city hall but had no luck. Then this random guy who was a buyer or friend after i told him its still being tracked actually asked me \"well hey where exactly is the tracker at on the bike\" Well needless to say the clean version of my answer is no of your business at all it my tracker for my property why you need to know is stupid and proves you know who and what I'm looking for, he somewhere in his imagination really thought I would tell him where it was what a reject, he tried to cover it up with well I'm just trying to help but when I replied not so nicely and reminded him i never asked for his or his friends help and also where the officers were i didn't have a day to sit hit because he was telling stories or had never call them anyways it becomes easy to tell or read people and their true intent as well as the actions maybe taken but probably just lied about to use as a threat but when you prove your knowledge of the law to be far beyond and how much more a cop would be helpful for you there's a pause and a look at or thru you of disbelief that 1 I would make you eat your own teeth if you want to go that route I'm a 6'4 only about 265 now maybe little more but I am a 2 time D2 national champion x college football O line men pulling guard to in fact so it always fun to see how scared and sheer unbelief in my speed at my size or #2 that not one of there stupid and unreal threats of legal action or anything else especially when one claimed to just be a pest guy and might of been as he wasn't trying to intimidate or anything really. Needless to say i believe they were buyers because all of a sudden he went back and left and once again my tag was on the move I should of had him at Costco but it wasn't giving me the I was so close circle and direction with distance option like usual but now when i call the cops in the morning with the tag evidence and that it is now been back at his house where it started after leaving mine as well as the little bit of CELL/GPS data i can give them and oh yeah the clear of day VIDEO CAMERA FOOTAGE i have of the loser taking it from my back yard believe just start with that route because what i did has been a wasted of time since my dad drove I would o had his ass but whatever. Definately the tracker you have been looking for if like me you have tried all others and got lame response this guided me from down the street to my house thru my house and right to the keys it was on A++++ in my book and only choice pluse they make holders or hiders for everything to go everywhere and some thing i would recomend if not but for some one i know that needed on just to show how great they truly work anyone saying otherwise lives in the middle of no where with no other apple device around or is expecting it to do things almost no true tracker can and thats fact cause i have tested the out to and they are the top of the line no bs best you will find and i had the old samsung cell tracker that was good to but had no battery life really.",
            "The Apple AirTag is hands down one of the most useful gadgets I‚Äôve ever purchased. From the moment I unboxed it, it exceeded my expectations in terms of both performance and ease of use.\n\nFirst off, setting it up was unbelievably simple. All I had to do was bring the AirTag close to my iPhone, and within seconds, it popped up on my screen, ready to pair. The instructions were clear, and the entire process took less than a minute. I didn‚Äôt have to deal with complicated apps, codes, or manuals. It felt seamless and intuitive, exactly what you‚Äôd expect from an Apple product.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk about how well it works. I‚Äôve attached the AirTag to my keys, which I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit I lose almost daily. Thanks to the AirTag, I can now find them in seconds. The ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app is incredibly accurate. Whether my keys are buried in the couch cushions or left in the car, the app pinpoints their location with impressive precision. The ability to make the AirTag play a sound is also a game changer. The chime is loud enough to hear even in another room, saving me from a lot of unnecessary stress.\n\nThe range is excellent, too. Around the house, it works flawlessly with Bluetooth, and if I ever leave my keys somewhere out of range, the AirTag uses Apple‚Äôs vast network of devices to locate them. It‚Äôs reassuring to know that even if I lose something miles away, there‚Äôs still a good chance I can track it down.\n\nOne feature I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd use much but now love is Precision Finding. When I‚Äôm close to the AirTag, my phone gives me exact directions, distance, and all. It‚Äôs like having a tiny GPS tracker for my everyday essentials.\n\nThe design is sleek and minimal, making it easy to attach to various items without being bulky or out of place. I appreciate that Apple designed it to be so versatile; whether it‚Äôs on my keys, in my bag, or even attached to a pet‚Äôs collar, it blends in perfectly.\n\nThe battery life is also impressive. Apple promises about a year of use before needing a replacement, and the battery is user-replaceable. It‚Äôs a relief to know I won‚Äôt have to toss the entire thing out or deal with a complicated replacement process.\n\nOverall, the Apple AirTag is one of those products that does exactly what it promises, and it does it exceptionally well. If you‚Äôre someone who constantly misplaces things or just wants a bit more peace of mind, this is absolutely worth the investment. It‚Äôs reliable, easy to use, and backed by Apple‚Äôs ecosystem, which means you know you‚Äôre getting a quality product.\n\nI highly recommend the AirTag to anyone who values convenience and wants a simple solution to keep track of their belongings.",

            "So I‚Äôm kind of new to the amazon device family. We just got our echo a few months ago. I‚Äôve been a prime member for over 10 years so I‚Äôm familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It‚Äôs been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I‚Äôm an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven‚Äôt had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I‚Äôve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I‚Äôm not sure what that is about.\nANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it‚Äôs not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn‚Äôt just recognize it.\nSetup:\nSince my Alexa didn‚Äôt recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to ‚Äúturn off plug one‚Äù and it turned off! It is so cool!\nFuture:\nI think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.\nComparing:\nWith so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can‚Äôt see myself buying any more than 1 for $25. Too many are 2 for $20. While it‚Äôs nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can‚Äôt afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.\nOverall:\nIf you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do! This smart plug is easy and awesome! But if you‚Äôre on a tight budget like I am, I would try a different brand first and see if those will work just as well.\nEvery time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option. My reviews are always my honest opinion and I try to include photos if possible.\nIf my review has helped you in any way, please click the \"helpful\" button below so that I know! If you have any questions feel free to ask! Thank you!",
            "In the past I have used a variety to products. Some of which required a hub and most of which required using their own app.\n\nAs time passed some of the companies have discontinued the products I used and others found their software was not highly secured.\n\nI then decided to try the Alexa solution and found it to be easy to set up using the Alexa Smart Plug. These plugs are fairly expensive so I thought I would try another brand that was less expensive, but advertised to work with Alexa.\n\nIt did not take me long to find that you had to use their app along with Alexa. With internet security continuing to be an issue I returned to the Alexa solution which I trust, and continue to find that it satisfies my needs with minimum effort.",
            "I am so happy with these. I only bought 1, just in case they didn't work properly. After using this, I have bought 2 more. I received an email suggesting I set up my device before I receive it. I went through the instructions in that email. When the plug arrived, all I had to do was plug the lamp into it. The device already had a name & Alexa understood what to do with it. Now the hard part is going to be remembering I have that plug & actually talking to turn on the lights. =)",
            "Love this product. I‚Äôm not gonna rant and rave all of the things it can do because that it is in the advertisements. But this thing came in very handy to turn small kitchen appliances off automatically. Lamps, alarm clocks. It‚Äôs really nifty. I also got it on sale for $4 which is super affordable. I‚Äôve tried other brands and none of them are as seamless and easy to use as the amazon one is. I‚Äôll tell you a secret I like telling my Alexa to turn on and off my lights for fun.",
            "This was easy to install and it worked well, for about a week. Alexa could no longer find it and I did the 12 second factory reset (press the button on the side) but that would not fix it. I only used it to turn on a bedroom lamp. I requested a replacement and hope that one works better.",
            "Works great. I just wish it had two plugs now. I do like that it doesn't take up too much room. I have mine plugged under my plug in. If they could add another plug and maybe a phone charging port, it would be genius. I love that I can turn the light off from my bedroom using the app, and that the light turns on automatically from my location when I pull into my garage.",
            "I plugged this into an outlet and opened the Alexa app on my phone and it connected in seconds (I have a couple of other smart plugs, maybe that facilitated the connection of this one). The only things I had to do was to rename it (for my benefit) and to set it as a \"light\" (as opposed to a plug), that way Alexa applies the same routine to it that I have set up for my other smart plugs that control lights.",
            "I love the Amazon smart plug. I purchased a new lamp which has three liight. It is so easy to set my light with my Amazon smart plug. All I have to due is ask alexia on ny show 5 to tell the app to turn on or off my lights to complete when the activity."

            "I bought the lighter pair as a 2nd pair bcuz my daughter had bought me the dune color, and I love them so much. I needed the darker ones to go with the other 2 bcuz they are limited editions: bcuz things are better in 3's lol and they are so hard to come across. The build quality is amazing make sure you get the insurance too! I spilled water in my purse, and they got ruined! I got them replaced by apple for $30' it took less than a week and I had a new pair!\n\nThey connect very quickly on Apple devices and androids; the design quality is amazing...they are beats and they are way cheaper than the Apple headphones. The battery lasts an entire week if you're only using them for a short time. I feel that they are very durable if you keep them away from water!\n\nThese are so nice but, I am afraid of make-up transfer getting on them, so I don't use them that much. They will look good with light color clothing for sure.\n\nThen I ordered the darker ones (earth I think) and when I got them, they were in a box with NONE of the items they come with (not even the case) I returned them the next day! They keep moving my day that I am supposed to get my refund bcuz they really don't want to give you your money back they would rather put it on a gift car, then you would get your money back in a matter of days!\n\nJust spend the extra money and get the ones with all the packaging, the wires and the bag! Do not get like new or anything like that being cheap bcuz you will not get your money back as quickly as they take it, trust me!",
            "I bought the Beats Studio Pro wireless headphones (black) mainly to use at the gym, and honestly, it was a great choice. I used to wear AirPods, but they kept falling out during workouts. These stay in place, feel super comfortable, and sound amazing.\n\n‚Ä¢ Functionality:\n\nYes, they work exactly as described. The Bluetooth connection is fast and reliable, and they also support USB-C to USB-C audio for lossless playback. They include a 3.5mm analog audio cable too, which is great for flexibility.\n\n‚Ä¢ Quality & Materials:\n\nThe build quality is top-notch. They feel sturdy and premium, with soft cushions that stay comfortable even during long sessions. The matte black finish gives them a sleek, professional look.\n\n‚Ä¢ Design:\n\nThe design is well thought out. They come with a hard carrying case, a quick start guide, and a warranty card. I also bought them with AppleCare, so I‚Äôm covered in case of any issues.\n\n‚Ä¢ User Experience:\n\nMy user experience has been very positive. I mainly use them for the gym and they perform incredibly well. The active noise canceling blocks distractions, and the transparency mode is handy when I need to be aware of my surroundings. The battery is a huge highlight‚Äîit lasts up to 40 hours on a single charge!\n\n‚Ä¢ Value for Money:\n\nWhile they‚Äôre not cheap, they deliver premium audio, versatile connectivity, and serious comfort. With AppleCare, I also get peace of mind. Totally worth the investment.\n\n‚Ä¢ Comparison to Similar Products:\n\nCompared to AirPods, these are way better for working out‚Äîmore secure, better isolation, and much longer battery life. Against Sony or Bose, they might lack deep customization, but they shine in design and bass power.\n\n‚Ä¢ Additional Notes:\n\nI absolutely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for strong performance, comfort, and long battery life. The product arrived in perfect condition, well-packaged, and with all the included accessories.",
            "My earliest forays into a More expensive headphone was with the Beats Brand and the wired Beats Pro headphones. Then I graduated to the wireless Beats Studios, as well as the Executive headphones and those were my headphones for years. I don‚Äôt recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn‚Äôt take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don‚Äôt really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn‚Äôt bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I‚Äôve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth‚Äôs settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use ‚ÄúHey, Siri‚Äô but I‚Äôve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the ‚ÄúB‚Äù button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can‚Äôt really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn‚Äôt a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I‚Äôm a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don‚Äôt like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!",
            "Hey everyone! üòÄ\nJust want to start off with saying, I wanted headphones for the longest time, but didn‚Äôt want to spend a crazy amount of money. So I bout the JBL 720BT headphones. And they were good. They had good bass and sound was meh. But I just couldn‚Äôt hear the music as well because my ears are toast due to my years in construction. I bite the bullet and I got the (BEATS STUDIO PROS) and man I got to say, I‚Äôve never been so excited over any electronics in my life. The volume levels are high, the noise cancelling is right on par, the comfort, durability, and transparency mode is unbelievable. I can hear so much better!\n\nI would 1000% recommend these headphones to anyone who works in construction who have crap ears.\nI am so pleased with my purchase.\nA lot of people are hating on the fact that it doesn‚Äôt have good bass, but it‚Äôs good enough!\nAlso, I like the fact that it is compatible with my iPhone that is a bonus!",

            "I wasn‚Äôt sure I needed another Alexa device in my life, but I also wasn‚Äôt sure I needed a new coffee maker until I tried one, so here we are. The Amazon Echo Pop with Alexa has officially earned a permanent spot in my home‚Äîand I‚Äôm actually mad I didn‚Äôt get it sooner.\n\nFirst, the sound. I was shocked at how clear and surprisingly full the sound is for such a compact speaker. It doesn‚Äôt just play music, it fills the room without making me feel like I‚Äôm listening to a tin can. No, it‚Äôs not a full surround sound system, but for the size and price, it‚Äôs incredibly impressive.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about the looks. The Echo Pop has this sleek, minimalistic design that blends seamlessly into any room. It doesn‚Äôt look like some gadget that screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to take over your life,‚Äù but more like ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm here to help you with whatever you need, and I look adorable doing it.‚Äù\n\nAnd, of course, it‚Äôs Alexa. So, whether I‚Äôm asking for the weather, setting timers, or controlling the smart lights, Alexa responds quickly and reliably. It's like having a personal assistant who doesn't judge you for asking the same question 12 times (like when the UPS package will arrive).\n\nBut here‚Äôs where it gets fun: We‚Äôve set up a routine with Alexa that automatically plays music when the dogs start barking. It‚Äôs like Alexa becomes our \"bark interrupter\"‚Äîwe get a little peaceful music playing while the dogs realize the barking isn‚Äôt necessary. Honestly, it‚Äôs the best use of tech I never knew I needed. Plus, it‚Äôs a nice little bonus to get the tunes rolling during those random barking bursts.\n\nWhy I love it: ‚Ä¢ Great sound quality for the size‚Äîfills the room without being overwhelming. ‚Ä¢ Easy setup, like every Alexa device I‚Äôve ever had. Plug it in, connect, and you‚Äôre good to go. ‚Ä¢ A sleek, stylish design that actually fits into any space without being obtrusive. ‚Ä¢ Alexa! Need I say more? It‚Äôs like having a mini tech genie at your command. ‚Ä¢ And the best part: our barking routine. The music starts up when the dogs get too loud. Genius.\n\nVine Team, if you‚Äôre looking for reviewers who can talk about both smart tech and the fact that this little thing has a surprisingly fun personality‚Äîlook no further. I‚Äôve got dogs, music, and a soft spot for gadgets that actually work.",
            "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5 stars)\n\nI've been using the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) for a week or so now, and it has truly transformed my smart home experience. The design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into any room. The sound quality is impressive for a device of this size‚Äîrich bass, clear vocals, and a good volume range make it perfect for music, podcasts, or voice commands.\n\nThe Alexa voice assistant is highly responsive and versatile. I use it daily to set reminders, control smart home devices, ask for weather updates, and even get news briefings. The integration with other smart home products has been smooth, allowing me to control lights, thermostats, and locks effortlessly.\n\nSetup was straightforward via the Alexa app, and the device recognizes my voice commands quickly. The microphone array is excellent at picking up commands even from across the room, and the privacy features, like the microphone off button, provide peace of mind.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) to anyone looking to add a smart speaker to their home. It‚Äôs a great combination of functionality, design, and affordability.",
            "The Amazon Echo Pop is the perfect little smart speaker with a big personality! I got it to use in a smaller room, and it‚Äôs been fantastic. The sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for its size ‚Äî great for music, podcasts, and even voice responses from Alexa.\n\nSetup was super simple ‚Äî just a few taps in the Alexa app and it was ready to go. Alexa responds quickly and accurately, and it easily connects to smart devices around the house. I use it for timers, weather updates, smart lights, and more, all hands-free.\n\nThe design is sleek and compact, so it fits perfectly on a nightstand or shelf without taking up space. It adds a nice modern touch to the room and comes in fun colors too.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a small but mighty smart speaker for your home or office, the Echo Pop is a great choice. Affordable, functional, and fun ‚Äî highly recommend!",
            "I picked up the Echo Pop in Midnight Teal, and I‚Äôm honestly impressed with how much this little speaker can do. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit anywhere‚Äîmine‚Äôs on a small shelf in the kitchen‚Äîbut the sound quality is still crisp and clear, with surprisingly rich bass for the size.\n\nAlexa responds quickly, even with background noise, and it works great for everything from setting timers to streaming music or controlling smart devices. I also really like the color‚Äîit adds a nice pop (no pun intended!) to the room without being too flashy.\n\nSetup was fast, and the whole experience feels polished. Amazon clearly put a lot of thought into making this a great budget-friendly smart speaker.\n\nI‚Äôd love the chance to try and review more Amazon devices. I enjoy giving detailed, honest feedback, and the Echo Pop shows just how much Amazon keeps improving its tech‚Äîeven in the smallest packages."

            "I purchased this 10ft extension cord with multiple outlets to help organize my home office setup, and it‚Äôs been one of those small upgrades that made a big difference. With a longer reach and more plug options, it‚Äôs incredibly versatile and eliminates the need for multiple power strips or awkward furniture rearranging.\n\nDesign & Build Quality\n\nThe cord feels durable and well-insulated, with a thick jacket that doesn‚Äôt twist or tangle easily. The 10-foot length gives you a lot of flexibility, especially if your outlets are inconveniently placed. Whether you‚Äôre running it behind a couch, under a desk, or across a room, it handles the job without feeling flimsy or overloaded.\n\nThe outlets are spaced well enough to accommodate several bulky plugs (like chargers or power bricks) without blocking the adjacent ones. Some models include USB ports, which I highly recommend‚Äîit‚Äôs super handy for charging phones, tablets, or even smart devices without taking up an AC slot.\n\nPerformance\n\nI‚Äôve been using it to power a mix of devices‚Äîlaptop charger, monitor, desk lamp, fan, and a phone charger‚Äîall at once, and it hasn‚Äôt shown any signs of stress (no overheating, buzzing, or flickering). The surge protection feature is also a great peace-of-mind addition, especially for electronics.\n\nKey Benefits:\n‚Ä¢ Extra Length (10 ft): Perfect for hard-to-reach outlets\n‚Ä¢ Multiple Outlets: Ideal for home offices, bedrooms, or entertainment centers\n‚Ä¢ Sturdy Construction: Feels safe and reliable, even under continuous use\n‚Ä¢ Optional USB Ports: Great for charging without extra adapters\n‚Ä¢ Surge Protection (on some models): Helps protect expensive devices\n\nMinor Drawbacks:\n‚Ä¢ If you need something ultra-compact or travel-friendly, this might feel bulky\n‚Ä¢ Some versions only have outlets on one side, which can limit placement flexibility\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nWhether you‚Äôre setting up a workstation, organizing behind the TV, or just tired of short cords and limited plugs, this 10ft multi-outlet extension cord is a solid buy. It‚Äôs one of those practical, everyday items that pays off in convenience and reliability. Highly recommend for anyone who needs a cleaner, safer, and more flexible power setup.",
            "I brought this for a camping event where I was sleeping in a tent cabin that was outfitted with an outlet. There's only one outlet per cabin tent and not all of the cots in the tent cabin are close to the outlet. I had to charge my cochlear implant batteries overnight so I can hear, and I'd rather charge my cell phone overnight than have to wait until driving home and using my car USB port to charge it. Fortunately I lucked out with the cot in the tent cabin that was the closest one to the outlet, but if I ended up in one of the cots much further from the outlet, this would have extended far enough to plug into the outlet and still have my charging devices close by. And there was plenty of room to share an outlet or two on this extension cord outlet with others sharing the tent cabin who needed to charge their devices overnight, too. It works great at home when I need to plug in a lighted Christmas Candelabra as well since the plug it comes with isn't long enough to reach the nearest outlet.",
            "I initially got the 10ft cable and loved it so much that I got the 5ft cable too for traveling. There are enough outlets for at least 6 gadgets, not including the USB ports.",
            "I bought this for my son who was headed for the dorms in college. I combined this with some special tape to mount it to the metal bedpost. It worked out perfectly. He could plug in his phone and tablet for charging. He also has his clamp bed light to plug in. The cord was long enough that we could run it underneath the bed along the wall, so it's completely out of site. And with it mounted, it's completely out of the way. He is now coming to the end of his first year and said he had zero issues with it. Tested and approved! I would definitely buy again. I'm actually thinking about buying one for myself!",
            "I love this multi-plug extension cord. I recently moved & don't have as many outlets as I previously had, so I needed a couple of power strips. I almost bought a traditional power strip until I saw this. It has two USB plugs & one USB-C plug, as well as SIX outlets! And what is really nice about these outlets vs a traditional power strip is that they're side-by-side in sets of two, so if you have something with one of those huge oversized plugs, you won't lose another outlet by it getting covered up by the big plug (I hope I explained that OK). It also has a 10 foot cord. I'm really happy with it & bought a second one.",
            "This extension cord is very nice, it is very long and I love the flat plug! I can charge multiple devices at the same time, but the only downside is that it gets pretty hot after a while, even with just one device charging.\n\nWould recommend buying for work, home, and on trips!",
            "This works perfectly to allow for multiple different types of devices to be plugged in by my bed all at once. We now have these on every floor of our home. Operates very well and is durable.",
            "This is great. I love the \"cube\" style verses the bar style. it also has ports for USB cords ....just in case. We used this at our BBQ for the 4 heating mats that we placed on the table to keep our trays of food warm."

            "I was very surprised when I found this product, which includes the cable for only $30. Originally, I was just looking to replace my factory Apple charging block for my MacBook Pro, and was fully prepared to spend $70 on the block, and up to another $20-30 on the cable. In fact, I went to Best Buy, looking to do just that - but they no longer sold the original Apple product. So, instead, I spent $70 on some off-brand which I didn‚Äôt like, for multiple reasons..\n\nFirst of all, if I‚Äôm going to spend that much money, I‚Äôm buying the original Apple product; it‚Äôs as simple as that. So, I bought the damn thing temporarily, just to have something to use until I could order the Apple one; which, in fact, I was searching for here on Amazon, and surprisingly did not find. That‚Äôs how I found this product, instead.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm a bit of a review snob. If a product isn‚Äôt 4.5+ stars, with a credible amount of reviews, I‚Äôm probably not buying it. But, even at this price point, this product was holding a full five stars - so I settled on trying it, instead of going directly to Apple. I love it, honestly. I don‚Äôt have any REAL complaints. Just one tiny little thing, that doesn‚Äôt really matter. Especially at the end of the day, for this price.\n\nThe one that I returned to Best Buy drove me INSANE, because the damn thing was so heavy that it sagged from every outlet you plugged it into. It didn‚Äôt feel ANYTHING like the original Apple charger, and it CONSTANTLY fell out of the socket and interrupted my usage experience. Oh, man I cannot tell you how annoying that was.. and I forget why, now but there was something else about the cable, too that just felt nothing like the one I had been using for the last five years. I just, hated it. All around.\n\nThis bundle, though is almost exactly the same size as the Apple one, and even a smidge smaller, I think, which is nice. It‚Äôs light, as it should be and it actually stays plugged in. That was a pleasant surprise, because at this point I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I have no complaints whatsoever about the charging block (which is the expensive part, obviously). I have no use for about half of the power of this thing, since my device only uses a maximum of just over 60 watts, so I can‚Äôt attest to an increase in charging speed, or anything like that. But, as a replacement for the factory original device, for even less than half the price, I can say that I am surprisingly pleased.\n\nOne of the great things about USB-C and Power Delivery, is that overkill is no problem. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs any worry of pulling too much power, and damaging your device. So, for the fact that this product successfully works as a replacement for my Apple charger, AND includes a free upgrade to upgrade-proof, especially at this price point, is just a really nice added bonus.\n\nThe only complaint that I have, is with the cable. It is decently annoying, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me because the product overall is such a great value. When plugged in to my MacBook Pro, it will (pretty often, actually) slip out of the USB-C port, justtt enough to disconnect from the device and stop charging. I have to gently snug it back in there, and it only moves this tiny little indeterminate amount. You would never be able to tell, by just looking at it that the connector isn‚Äôt fully seated in place, but when you slide it back in, you can feel it move a teeny bit, and you can feel it kind of snap back into place. Again, moderately annoying, but I don‚Äôt particularly find this to be a bother, considering I was perfectly willing and prepared to spend 2-3 times the amount of this product on the genuine Apple version. For the value? I really can‚Äôt complain.\n\nPlus, if I ever decide that it indeed IS a bother, I could always buy another cable for $20 or less. Hell, I could even buy one straight from Apple, and I‚Äôm STILL saving money. So, again, I really can‚Äôt complain. For the manufacturer, though: I would definitely recommend replacing the cable that you offer, with this bundle to eliminate this issue. Cables are cheap, and even if you have to raise the price on this bundle accordingly (what, $1.00? $1.50?), it‚Äôs worth it to do so. I mean, come on; the charging block itself is a great value, at this price. The cable is just a bonus, anyway.",
            "This 118W charger works perfectly with my MacBook Pro (M2) and charges it just as fast as the original Apple charger. I‚Äôve also used it with my iPad Pro and Samsung phone, and it works without any issues. The build quality feels solid, and the included USB-C cable is a great bonus. It stays cool during use and is compact enough to carry when traveling. For the price, it offers excellent performance and reliability. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful and versatile USB-C charger.",
            "This charger delivers fast, reliable power for my MacBook Pro (M2), and it performs just like the original Apple version. The 118W output is more than enough to handle my laptop, iPad, and even my Samsung phone. Charging is quick and consistent, with no overheating or interruptions.\n\nThe included USB-C cable is sturdy and long, which makes it convenient for use at a desk or on the couch. The charger itself feels well-built and compact enough to travel with.\n\nWhat really makes this stand out is the price. It does everything the Apple charger does but costs significantly less. If you need a dependable USB-C charger for multiple devices, this is a great choice.",
            "I left my MacBook Pro charger at someone‚Äôs house and had work to do. So I got this overnighted. It was the right value for me. I love Apple but their products are so expensive. And this is a great place to save money. There is no reason to spend all that money on Apples when this charger works perfectly, is high quality and a fraction of the cost. It‚Äôs fully compatible with my laptop. It‚Äôs the same size as the previous charger, and it seems to be very well made. Very happy it came with the cable too! Thank you!! This saved my weekend!!",
            "\"I'm thrilled with this Mac charger! The 6-foot cord is a game-changer, giving me plenty of flexibility to work from anywhere in the room. The charger is fast and efficient, keeping my MacBook Pro powered up with ease. The build quality is excellent, and the magnetic tip is a nice touch. It's a great alternative to Apple's original charger at a more affordable price. Highly recommend for MacBook owners looking for a reliable and convenient charging solution!\"",
            "I bought this 118W USB-C charger to use it with my MacBook Pro with M2 chip, and the truth is that it has exceeded my expectations. Charges very fast: in less than 30 minutes I have more than half of the battery ready. I have also used it with my iPad Pro and my Samsung Galaxy, and it works perfectly in all of them.\nThe charger includes a resistant USB-C to USB-C cable of good length, which is very much appreciated, because some other chargers do not bring it. The design is compact, ideal to carry in the backpack or on a trip. In short, if you need a powerful and versatile charger, this is an excellent choice. Good quality, good price and with cable included. Highly recommended.",

The 6-foot extension cord gives plenty of reach, and it tucks away easily as the desk moves up and down.\n\nIt‚Äôs also reassuring to have 2700 joules of surge protection, especially with all the electronics I have plugged in.

I had a recent power outage and none of my devices had any issues when the power came back.\nNice, long extension.\n\nCon -\nCan't think of any; it serves my needs",
            "I used this in my dorm room and it was great. It's specifically surge-protected, which was in compliance for my specific dorm. I HIGHLY recommend checking any housing rules before purchasing if you're a college student/have rules on what kind of extension cords you can have in a space. Aside from that, the product was also useful in a number of ways. There are the regular plug-ins, as well as 4 USB plug spots for things like phone chargers, which was handy and didn't take up more plug-in space. It's not too bulky or short, but it's not going to be in the way with too long of a cord either. This was exactly what I needed and was worth the price.",
            "Desperately needed additional plug-in capabilities! This 12-outlet surge protector is easy to use and works well. I like the size of the strip (see the picture and note how it shows 2 outlets set apart to accommodate bulky plugs while the rest are regularly spaced), has 2 little lights to show it's working, and the 4 USB \"charging outlets\" (3 USB-A's and 1 USB-C). It is not a \"super fast\" USB-C charger, but it does a decent job with the additional security of the surge protection. One thing I wish I'd known before purchasing is the limitation of 750 watts per outlet max. If an item to be plugged in exceeds that wattage, the company recommends you plug that item directly into the wall receptacle and not the surge protector. Still, all in all, it is a good value, has a high star rating (with a lot of reviews), and fits a lot of plugged in items in a compact space. If you have limited outlets, of course, use common sense and don't overload your electric capacity. However, this surge protector is responsible for a definite up-tick in my morale! I can heartily recommend!",
            "Looks good. Lots of receptacles. However, the enclosed paperwork describes the product and suggests getting a stronger \"professional\" model. I selected this one because of the number of joules protection. So, Hmmmm?",
            "Estoy muy satisfecha con esta compra. El producto lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones y dentro del tiempo estimado. La calidad supera mis expectativas: se nota que est√° hecho con buenos materiales y cumple exactamente con lo que promete en la descripci√≥n",
            "A nice 12 plug A.C. power strip with USB plug ins. I got the power strip with the 6 foot cord and it is working OK. 2 of the outlets are spaced for transformers. The unit is a good size for all the plug-ins it has and surge protection. A good value.",

            "Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with the Blink camera system (and I‚Äôm not paying for the subscription). One of the reasons I decided to buy into this system was because I didn‚Äôt need a subscription for: 1) Live view option, which means, see the live video from the cameras any time I want via the app, from anywhere. 2) Save videos that were triggered by motion to a USB flash drive (memory stick) inside my house (not cloud only and not stored in the camera itself). Keep in mind, most of my comments here will be related to using the system without a subscription, but I‚Äôll comment on the differences where possible. Also, my comments may be a little more technical than most people would like, but for anyone interested, I‚Äôm being as detailed as possible :-) These comments are relevant as of Feb 2024 (the date I wrote this review).\n\nViewing/Storing Your Videos: During the trial subscription period when I could view my motion-triggered saved videos in the cloud, I noticed the videos load/play quicker than if you‚Äôre accessing the videos stored on the USB flash drive in the Sync Module 2. Anyway, not a big deal, but it‚Äôs a difference. You need to provide a USB flash drive to plug in to the Sync Module, but those are very cheap these days and a 128GB drive will give you TONS of storage for videos since the file size of the videos is not very big. Also, with the cloud subscription there‚Äôs a thumbnail for each video saved, which can be helpful in finding important videos if you‚Äôre trying to find one with people in it, rather than a video triggered by a dog. Without a subscription, there‚Äôs no thumbnail on the saved videos which you view in your app, and it takes several seconds for them to load/play in your app, but it‚Äôs bearable. The nice thing is, if you don‚Äôt have a subscription, the videos save to your flash drive/memory stick in the Sync Module 2 immediately after the recording is finished. If you have a subscription, the videos only download to your Sync Module‚Äôs USB flash drive once per day, at night (as I understand it).\n\nSync Module 2 & Wireless Signals to Wi-Fi & Cameras: The Sync Module is required for the cameras, but you get one of those if you buy a package, like I did. I bought the bundle that included two Outdoor 4 cameras, one video doorbell and the Sync Module 2. It‚Äôs important to know the Sync Module and the cameras have TWO wireless signals. One that needs to connect to your home (or business) 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network and one that is only for use by the Sync Module and cameras and that signal is a ‚ÄòLow-Frequency Radio‚Äô (LFR) signal. It does not have 5GHz, but you don‚Äôt want that anyway because the 5GHz signal is weaker than 2.4GHz signal. The Sync Module is where you connect a USB flash drive (memory stick) to save your videos if you‚Äôre not paying for a subscription (and also for once-daily backups of your videos if you ARE paying for a subscription). PLACEMENT OF THE SYNC MODULE IS IMPORTANT! Remember, it has TWO signals. It needs to be placed in an area that has a good signal to your home/business Wi-Fi AND so that it also has a good signal to all your cameras (if you have them spread out in different areas around your home or outside your home). To give you some perspective, my house is a single-story ranch style house (around 1,700 sq ft) and I have a camera outside on each wall (each wall is brick). I was able to place the Sync Module and my Wi-Fi access point in the center of my house. Even in this central location, I have one camera (the video doorbell, about 38‚Äô away from sync module and Wi-Fi access point) that has only 2 to 3 bars (out of 4) for the Wi-Fi connection but usually 4 bars for the Sync Module connection. Long story short, make sure you place the sync module, your Wi-Fi access point and the cameras so they all connect to each other with as strong a signal as possible for best performance/reliability. It worked out well for my house, especially since I have flexibility on where I can place my sync module and home Wi-Fi access point and the technical knowledge and tools to move it wherever I needed it.\n\nOutdoor 4 Camera: The image quality/exposure for these cameras is very good. The nighttime IR (infrared) view is very good also (it will appear like black and white footage). The coverage of the IR light when it‚Äôs dark is also very good and has better coverage than I would have expected. I have motion-triggered flood lights outside my house anyway, so if my lights are triggered, the camera may not use IR because it sees enough light (at that point it will record normal video in color just like it does during daylight). I bought 25 ft long third-party USB-C cords with a power supply to use as the power source for my Outdoor 4 cameras so I never have to replace batteries and so I can view live video from the cameras as much as I want and also have the infrared light set to High without impacting battery life, because there are no batteries to worry about :-). I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs different WITH a subscription, but the longest period you can record when the camera is triggered by motion is 60 seconds. For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds, just so you know. Regarding the power, I drilled a hole in the bricks of my house (in the mortar actually) to feed power to my Outdoor 4 cameras. One camera is directly under a soffit, so there‚Äôs no danger of rain getting in there where the power cord connects (but the cord I bought is weather sealed anyway, not a normal USB-C cord). The other camera is mounted under a third-party security camera cover to keep the sun from beating down on it all summer (it‚Äôs on a south wall) and to keep rain off it, just in case‚Ä¶because again, I decided to power this one by a cord that plugs into the back of the camera instead of using the batteries). The included mount is very nice and flexible. If you mount an Outdoor 4 camera under a white security camera cover like I did, you may need to paint the underside of that cover with flat black paint because at night (in my case) the infrared light reflected off the underside of the cover/shield I‚Äôm using over my outdoor 4 camera and that made the video made difficult to see clearly. Daylight videos were unaffected, it was just at night in low light when the IR light was active for video recording that was a problem with that aftermarket cover I bought.\n\nDoorbell Camera: For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds. Why, I don‚Äôt know. Technical limitations? The Outdoor 4 cameras can record 60 seconds of motion triggered video. The wireless signals for the doorbell camera seem to be a little weaker than the outdoor 4 cameras. One big disappointment is that the video doorbell camera can NOT be powered by your existing doorbell power wire. My old Skybell brand video doorbell CAN be powered by the doorbell wires, so it‚Äôs a bummer that Blink can‚Äôt do the same. You can connect your existing doorbell wires to trigger your indoor doorbell, so that‚Äôs good‚Ä¶but like I said, you can‚Äôt use that wire to power the video doorbell. I confirmed this with Blink tech support. I hope they have a new version in the future that is able to be powered solely by the doorbell power wires, but for now, I have to keep batteries in it. The video doorbell device has a weaker infrared (IR) light than the Outdoor 4 cameras and lesser quality video than the Outdoor 4 cameras, but overall, it‚Äôs good (especially during daylight hours). The included mount is very nice and easy to install.\n\nMotion Triggering of Videos + Privacy: The settings/customization for when motion triggers video recording is very good. You have the option to block out as much of the scene as you need to to prevent unwanted triggering of video recordings, such an area of the scene where tree limbs often blow around or something like that. For privacy, you have the option to block out 2 custom size areas in the scene you select for privacy reasons so that area in the video is grayed out. The selected privacy area does not trigger when motion happens in that privacy section and also, when other sections in the scene that you allow to be seen trigger video, the video that's recorded has a gray box in the privacy section (all you see is a gray box). That's pretty powerful and useful, if you need it. Regarding motion triggered video recording in general, I've noticed the cameras can accidentally trigger (record) when it's really misty/foggy outside. If there's a lot of mist in the air floating by the motion sensor, it can trigger a recording. Just something to keep in mind because you may need to adjust the motion sensitivity and/or 'disarm' the cameras for a while until the mist clears because you may be getting lots of unwanted/accidental recordings. I have mine adjusted to the point where the cameras almost never accidentally record unless it's very misty outside, which isn't too often where I am.\n\nAudio Quality: The microphones on the Outdoor 4 and video doorbell camera pick up sound very well. I can clearly hear anyone speaking. The closer they are, the better of course, but it's very good. The speaker volume for the cameras is very good as well. It's plenty loud and if anyone is nearby when you activate the camera and start speaking, they'll hear it clearly :-)\n\nBlink App for Phone: The app you can download on your phone for managing the cameras/sync module is very nice and has plenty of options to configure/customize the cameras (motion settings, video quality, audio settings, check status, etc). The app is where you view your videos, but of course if you‚Äôre storing videos on the flash drive connected to the sync module, you can remove that flash drive and plug it in to your computer to see the video files there or make copies of the files for long-term storage‚Ä¶but of course you can also use the app to save a video file to your phone if you want to keep a copy of share it with someone, like the cops :-). I wish they had an app for Windows so I could view the cameras live and see saved videos on the sync module‚Äôs flash drive right from my computer, but at this point there‚Äôs no PC app. I think there used to be one?...but if there was, there isn‚Äôt one now (Feb 2024).\n\nPrice: I compared the price of this system and what it can do with other systems like Ring, Nest and Skybell and at this time, the price difference is significant, in my opinion. The Blink system (and what it offers even without a subscription) is better than the other systems I checked out.",
            "Just received this today, and it does show an improvement on the quality. Feels and looks beefier. When updating your activity zones, there are more squares to select than the previous versions of these cameras, which I like, to fine tune the areas I want. ** And, I think the inactive zones you set up, are ‚Äòactually‚Äô enforced and work as expected than the older generation cameras.\n\nTIP **25 September 2023 - For those having issues about wifi signal strength, you may need to mess with the router‚Äôs settings to increase signal power. If your router is between walls, behind the tv, etc. you will see degradation in performance and responsiveness in live view. I have a gaming router set on a high shelf, because routers work best when they‚Äôre in a high spot. My cameras that are outside have no issues with Wi-Fi strength and are responsive when live-viewing.\n\nField of view has improved significantly and you can see a large difference between versions of cameras.\n\nGood thing is that the mounts for the previous cameras WILL work on this camera. The mount it came with is an improvement to previous versions. Flat base, not cone-shaped.\n\nI‚Äôm currently trying the person detection from the trial with this camera, and will update over time on the performance.**Person Detection since having BO4 as the trial, has been great! It has significantly cut down on the amount of unwanted notifications caused by wind, car/sensor lights, animals, etc. I do feel that you can save battery life significantly, even when the sensitively is set higher. Having too many notifications does get annoying at times, but I think Blink is definitely making an initiative to make these camera a gamer-changer, while still maintaining ease of setup.\n\nPrice is a tad high, but you may consider the monthly payments, which I did.\n\n**28 August 2023 - Taking a snapshot/photo capture from these cameras, at night, non-night vision, pointing in a lighted area is sharp(er), than any previous version. No images included due to security. Haven‚Äôt tried night vision alone, but I‚Äôm confident the same sharpness is applied.\n\n**29 August 2023 - The Motion Recording Types cover Person Detection and All Motion. I have one camera set with Person Detection enabled with sensitivity level at 8, and it didn‚Äôt detect me driving my car in/out of the garage. I would‚Äôve thought Person Detection would encompass ‚Äòsome‚Äô normal motions, but I think we must take it at face value that when set to Person Detection, it will ONLY detect persons, you don‚Äôt get the best of both worlds unless selecting All Motion. Sounds dumb to say, but though I‚Äôd make it aware. Update** On a ‚Äòvery few‚Äô instances, this camera did detect my car entering and exiting our garage. So my thoughts originally have shifted, but I think over time with continued firmware updates, it will hone in on its accuracy.\n\n1 September 2023 - One camera fell offline/unresponsive. Suspicion is on firmware updates being applied, or, weather factors since it‚Äôs low 60¬∞ outside. No issues with home network or signal strength to camera. Will continue to monitor/self troubleshoot. **I took out the batteries, and tested them, showing still a full charge/health, and placed them back in, bringing the camera back online.\n\n4 September 2023 - One of my BO4 cameras with Person Detection enabled was at level 8 sensitivity, and on a windy day, did alert that there was a person at (insert camera name). It alerted a few times during the day (under 5 instances), but not a big deal. My guess would be that as BO4 continues to develop, the accuracy will improve in its detection.\n\n8 September 2023 - Setup of 3rd BO4 camera set in an area where there is minimal/no lights. Due to security, no images. Taking Live Photo with the IR intensity set at LOW. Some haziness/fuzziness but the area is lit up, and provides better detail than previous versions of Blink cameras. As you increase in IR sensitivity, the Live Photo (in HIGH IR setting) increased in sharpness and reduces glare and fuzziness significantly. **I placed some solar floodlights in the area of this BO4, and with low IR sensitivity and once the lights are triggered, the video capture was much sharper than previous versions of Blink cameras. I only have video quality set at normal, so I‚Äôm impressed with BO4 so far!\n\n28 September 2023 Another BO4 fell offline around 11pm. Last occurrence was due to a firmware update being deployed, so this may be due to the same thing.\n\n1 October 2023 - Installed my 4th BO4, as I‚Äôm looking at all the point of views both in the live shot and live view, it feels that it elongates everything. I know my driveway isn‚Äôt that long, but comparing it to previous generation cameras, BO4 view appears to add like 20ft+ to my driveway. I can understand the other reviews concerned about the range detection, as I do notice some times it will not catch movement, especially if I‚Äôm moving slowly or based on camera positioning, but at sensitivity level 8-9, I would like to catch movement at a farther range. As I continue to implement BO4, I will continue to observe performance.\n\n6 October 2023 - It appears one of my BO4s point toward the road at max sensitivity IS NOT catching cars passing by anymore. Seems that v13.34 that was pushed out, affected the range despite any setting changes. Not a concern (yet), but I‚Äôm hoping newer updates will fix range issues and sensitivity. **Update - camera seems to be capturing movement now at a lower sensitivity set at 6-7. May‚Äôve been a change in traffic flow by the house, in which there may be less cars, however, will continue to observe BO4 performance.\n\n4 November 2023 - Installed another BO4 camera while also upgrading one camera with a battery expansion kit. This is specifically for BO4 cameras, not previous versions. The expansion makes this camera much heavier, however, the mounts they come with (and previous) will support the weight without the mount drooping/moving. I‚Äôm not a fan of adding more bulk to the camera. Also, this battery expansion will not use camera‚Äôs battery slots, and instead uses the expansion for 4 batteries. I would‚Äôve preferred an integration that would‚Äôve retained the two onboard batteries + two for expansion. Other than that, the BO4 cameras have been wonderful to use, with overall quality/sharpness. I do hope that future updates will improve motion detection and range, respectively. Nonetheless, these are worth an upgrade from previous versions.\n\n15 November 2023 - I‚Äôve noticed recently that BO4 will notify of Motion/person and it will not record that instance. It happens sporadically, so it is a slight concern, but not enough deter me from purchasing another BO4. Over time as more updates are pushed to these cameras, I expect the overall effectiveness will improve.\n\n6 December 2023 - BO4 has been a great upgrade for my system. There are still occasions where I‚Äôll receive a notification of movement, but does not record that moment. It‚Äôs very rare now with the update to v13.41. I still see issues regarding the sensitivity not working as expected. One camera is set at 9, toward the road, and it does not always catch cars driving by. Not a showstopper, but I can see now it‚Äôs range detection could be an issue for others. With recent Blink app updates, you now can adjust the length of video recording (previously it was adjusted by every 5 seconds), which is great! Allows for better customization for your needs. I wish this was the same for the sensitivity (0-99 vs 1-9). Overall BO4 has been accurate with Person Detection, and the subscription for Blink Plus for $10/mon, is very reasonable for any household to use to expand features.\n\n27 January 2024 - BO4 has been working exceptionally well. I still have the Blink Plus subscription to allow the Person Detection feature, and it‚Äôs accurate. There were certain instances that BO4 cameras did not record movement such as my neighbor chopping his tree down. I also noticed there were connectivity issues during that time that left a large gap in my list of recordings. Not a showstopper, but concerning for those security moments. Range also plays a factor in detection, so I continue to hope that future updates will improve this. Overall, upgrading to this camera is well worth it. Wait for the sales to get these at a cheaper price.\n\n16 February 2024 - Decided to update the Blink Sync Module because I realized I was still using the 1st generation sync module. I updated to the 2nd generation sync module, and I noticed there‚Äôs more of a delay when live streaming my cameras. I did a reboot of the sync module a few times, but I still receive a slight delay. One camera I have at a longer distance is unable to be live viewed despite Wi-Fi and sync module connection have full bars/strong connectivity. Still attempting to troubleshoot but I think something about the firmware I updated to since it‚Äôs the first time connecting. Further investigation is needed. Overall, the cameras are working as expected!\n\n18 February 2024 - Identified that the issue was NOT the Sync Module 2, and rather my own internet. Reboot modem, router and network switch, and saw significant improvement in BO4 camera responsiveness. Additionally, I will take into factor that weather was not great at the time of incident. Since this, the Blink cameras are working as intended!\n\n22 April 2024 - I‚Äôve bumped up to the yearly Blink Plus subscription as the Person Detection feature has been wonderful! Eliminated unnecessary notifications caused by wind, sun/shadows, or other movement. It does save your batteries!\n\nThere are occasions where there is a notification of movement, however, it does not record/save the video. Not sure if there are delays, but I continue to have confidence as new firmware is pushed to BO4, it will improve overall performance. Since having these cameras, I haven‚Äôt had major issues, and Blink support have been helpful and receptive.\n\nOther things I‚Äôve noticed as far as delays in live streaming, are caused by your upload speeds. The higher your upload speeds are, the quicker the response is. Additionally, consider adjusting your Wi-Fi strength from your router/wireless access point, as this also contributes to the responsiveness.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with Blink Outdoor 4 cameras.\n\n8SEP2024 - BO4 Cameras have been great! When pairing it with the Blink subscription for cloud storage and the Person Detection feature, it‚Äôs helps with cutting down unnecessary movements caused by animals/shadows/etc.\n\nOccasionally, I would still receive Blink app notifications for movement, but it will not record it. Not sure if this is still an ongoing bug, or late push notifications from previous captures, but it doesn‚Äôt impact my rating for the product.\n\nI wish detection sensitivity was improved or expanded upon to allow for timely capture of events.\n\n10 April 2025 - Since my last update, BO4 continues to meet and exceed my expectations for a quick and easy setup for a camera system. While WiFi signal strength is not a concern for my cameras, it is something to think about for your best setup for these cameras. While there is a new Blink Sync Module XR which expands range, I have not used it for my setup.\n\nI‚Äôve changed/upgraded all my cameras to BO4, and I‚Äôve very pleased with the battery life, and the Person Detection feature to minimize recordings caused by animals, cars, lights, etc. Person Detection still needs a bit of work because a few times, it would detect deer, and notify me it‚Äôs a person. May be a deal breaker for some people, but, overall person detection is pretty accurate."

            "I wasn‚Äôt sure I needed another Alexa device in my life, but I also wasn‚Äôt sure I needed a new coffee maker until I tried one, so here we are. The Amazon Echo Pop with Alexa has officially earned a permanent spot in my home‚Äîand I‚Äôm actually mad I didn‚Äôt get it sooner.\n\nFirst, the sound. I was shocked at how clear and surprisingly full the sound is for such a compact speaker. It doesn‚Äôt just play music, it fills the room without making me feel like I‚Äôm listening to a tin can. No, it‚Äôs not a full surround sound system, but for the size and price, it‚Äôs incredibly impressive.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about the looks. The Echo Pop has this sleek, minimalistic design that blends seamlessly into any room. It doesn‚Äôt look like some gadget that screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to take over your life,‚Äù but more like ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm here to help you with whatever you need, and I look adorable doing it.‚Äù\n\nAnd, of course, it‚Äôs Alexa. So, whether I‚Äôm asking for the weather, setting timers, or controlling the smart lights, Alexa responds quickly and reliably. It's like having a personal assistant who doesn't judge you for asking the same question 12 times (like when the UPS package will arrive).\n\nBut here‚Äôs where it gets fun: We‚Äôve set up a routine with Alexa that automatically plays music when the dogs start barking. It‚Äôs like Alexa becomes our \"bark interrupter\"‚Äîwe get a little peaceful music playing while the dogs realize the barking isn‚Äôt necessary. Honestly, it‚Äôs the best use of tech I never knew I needed. Plus, it‚Äôs a nice little bonus to get the tunes rolling during those random barking bursts.\n\nWhy I love it: ‚Ä¢ Great sound quality for the size‚Äîfills the room without being overwhelming. ‚Ä¢ Easy setup, like every Alexa device I‚Äôve ever had. Plug it in, connect, and you‚Äôre good to go. ‚Ä¢ A sleek, stylish design that actually fits into any space without being obtrusive. ‚Ä¢ Alexa! Need I say more? It‚Äôs like having a mini tech genie at your command. ‚Ä¢ And the best part: our barking routine. The music starts up when the dogs get too loud. Genius.\n\nVine Team, if you‚Äôre looking for reviewers who can talk about both smart tech and the fact that this little thing has a surprisingly fun personality‚Äîlook no further. I‚Äôve got dogs, music, and a soft spot for gadgets that actually work.",
            "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5 stars)\n\nI've been using the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) for a week or so now, and it has truly transformed my smart home experience. The design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into any room. The sound quality is impressive for a device of this size‚Äîrich bass, clear vocals, and a good volume range make it perfect for music, podcasts, or voice commands.\n\nThe Alexa voice assistant is highly responsive and versatile. I use it daily to set reminders, control smart home devices, ask for weather updates, and even get news briefings. The integration with other smart home products has been smooth, allowing me to control lights, thermostats, and locks effortlessly.\n\nSetup was straightforward via the Alexa app, and the device recognizes my voice commands quickly. The microphone array is excellent at picking up commands even from across the room, and the privacy features, like the microphone off button, provide peace of mind.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) to anyone looking to add a smart speaker to their home. It‚Äôs a great combination of functionality, design, and affordability.",
            "The Amazon Echo Pop is the perfect little smart speaker with a big personality! I got it to use in a smaller room, and it‚Äôs been fantastic. The sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for its size ‚Äî great for music, podcasts, and even voice responses from Alexa.\n\nSetup was super simple ‚Äî just a few taps in the Alexa app and it was ready to go. Alexa responds quickly and accurately, and it easily connects to smart devices around the house. I use it for timers, weather updates, smart lights, and more, all hands-free.\n\nThe design is sleek and compact, so it fits perfectly on a nightstand or shelf without taking up space. It adds a nice modern touch to the room and comes in fun colors too.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a small but mighty smart speaker for your home or office, the Echo Pop is a great choice. Affordable, functional, and fun ‚Äî highly recommend!",
            "I picked up the Echo Pop in Midnight Teal, and I‚Äôm honestly impressed with how much this little speaker can do. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit anywhere‚Äîmine‚Äôs on a small shelf in the kitchen‚Äîbut the sound quality is still crisp and clear, with surprisingly rich bass for the size.\n\nAlexa responds quickly, even with background noise, and it works great for everything from setting timers to streaming music or controlling smart devices. I also really like the color‚Äîit adds a nice pop (no pun intended!) to the room without being too flashy.\n\nSetup was fast, and the whole experience feels polished. Amazon clearly put a lot of thought into making this a great budget-friendly smart speaker.\n\nI‚Äôd love the chance to try and review more Amazon devices. I enjoy giving detailed, honest feedback, and the Echo Pop shows just how much Amazon keeps improving its tech‚Äîeven in the smallest packages."

            "(Update 9/9: last night I was enjoying a podcast on these, and they were working great as usual. Suddenly, I heard a weird burst of static in my left ear. I turned the volume on my phone down, thinking it may have been coming from there. There was another burst of static. Hmm. I did a full restart on my iPhone 14 Plus, and on the headphones. More static. Oh no... I called Amazon, and they were great as always about arranging a return. This morning, I tried the Q20s again. No static. None. I called Anker and was on hold for awhile- about 20 minutes- but when I did get through, remarkably, *it was to a live human being*, and this human being was knowledgable, and took the time to answer all of my questions. Remarkably, he also did not try to sell me their priciest (and newest) pair of headphones, the Space 1s. He suggested, in fact, after listening to what I am wanting in a pair of headphones- decent sound, decent volume, good noise cancelling- that I get another pair of Q20s. Our conversation took place over the Q20 headphones. (By the way- not a nanosecond of static. And none since.) He also explained the Anker warranty. Any time any Anker product is purchased via Amazon, the warranty is immediately activated. You don't need to call Anker, send anything in, go online- nothing. The warranty starts as soon as your purchase is made. The warranty covers 18 months of product life. I am still considering purchasing the three year warranty offered by Amazon on top of that, as with my luck, the plastic \"headband\" (the crescent shaped piece of adjustable plastic that goes over your head) will disintegrate on day one of the 19th month.\n\nI was really impressed by the customer service I received throughout this phone call, and *really* appreciated that a live human being took my call. He was easy to understand, and obviously well-versed on his company's products. And also he didn't try to sell me ten things, or get me to sign up for anything or download anything. I am finding that this kind of service is becoming very rare these days.\n\nI do think I am going to purchase another pair of Q20s, as I really do like them. So far, they have shown zero sign of the ear cups separating or the plastic weakening or any part of them becoming compromised at all. And no more static in the left ear. Why did that happen- I'll never know, I suppose. But it is good to know that Anker stands behind their products, AND that a person actually answers the phone when you call. (Can you imagine?). I have had to deal with the \"customer service\" agents when I finally got through at Sony and that experience, sadly, convinced me to never purchase anything manufactured by Sony again. This experience with Anker, even though it did involve discussing a seemingly one-time malfunction in my headphones, has made a loyal customer out of me. Will update after the second pair of Ankers. Thank you!)\n\nI share a wall with my next door neighbor. Luckily, there is no one on the other side of me. There has never been an issue with the tenants in this unit making any kind of noise, and I have lived in my apartment since 2016. If you were in my apartment, you wouldn't even know anyone lived next door. Everything had been nice and tranquil as far as that apartment was concerned, for years. That is, until recently.\n\nEver experienced the joys of getting unwillingly serenaded by someone's throbbing subwoofer? The thing about being subjected to a stereo with a subwoofer going, is that the music might be barely audible, but you can *feel* the bass notes physically, especially if the stereo and subwoofer are physically nearby. And that is what is happening to me, right now. There are constant bass throbbings coming through the wall, coming from the apartment that had for so long been perfectly quiet. The music itself really isn't loud enough to be a nuisance. But the low frequency pulsations of the bass certainly *are* a nuisance. Apparently, the woman who owns that apartment has turned it over to her kids for who knows how long. Her kids are in their early 20s. Their stereo is never off, so their subwoofer is never off.\n\nI tried asking them to please realize they have neighbors, and their subwoofer is bothering their neighbors, and could they *please* limit the hours when they play their stereo. They just snarled something, and slammed the door in my face. They then started playing their stereo louder- not a lot louder, but noticeably louder. I next requested that the building Super speak to them. He did. They turned their stereo off for a few moments, after he spoke with them. I then heard the sound of something heavy being hurled against our mutual wall. Then, the stereo started up again. It was playing at a slightly lower volume. But the bass was still vibrating the wall.\n\nThere had been an issue, several years ago, with problem tenants right above me, who REALLY blasted their stereo with their powerful subwoofer at all hours. They were also selling drugs, and a stream of \"America's Most Wanted\" types were coming and going also at all hours. They used the back parking lot as a stolen car storage lot. Their \"guests\" started fires in the garbage cans in the lobby, after nodding out and dropping lit cigarettes into them, as they sat in the chairs out there. You don't want to know what they were doing in the laundry room. The list of their unpleasantness goes on and on. This went on for seven years.\n\nThe HOA here did nothing about them. Nothing. None of the HOA members lived in this state, so all they did was collect our money, and ignore our phone calls and emails about these nuisance, and dangerous, tenants. During this time, I developed PTSD, which was diagnosed by a psychiatrist, along with anxiety disorder and chronic depression. I rarely slept, and could barely function at my jobs. Finally, after seven years, there was a change in HOA personnel. Eventually, the problem tenants were evicted. I could hardly believe how peaceful it then became here.\n\nThinking they would have my back, I emailed the current HOA regarding the current situation with the eternally pulsating stereo. I had recently noticed some \"please be courteous to other tenants, and keep your noise down between 10pm and 8am\" hand written notices posted around the lobby and in the hallways. I don't know if they are aimed at these particular tenants, but it seems as if this building again has some residents who are inspiring complaints.\n\nThe HOA told me, basically, that I was on my own. The HOA just told me to keep ‚Äúnegotiating‚Äù with the neighbors, who had already demonstrated they could care less if they are bothering me. I will be checking on legal representation this following week, as I am disabled, and my disability was caused in part by the constant unpleasant behavior I was subjected to by the tenants upstairs when the HOA did nothing years ago for so long, though I emailed and called them about their activities, which clearly were in violation of the HOA bylaws, over and over again. It looks like I have another situation like that on my hands again.\n\nHowever! I thought- what can I do that can help me right now? I typed \"sound canceling wireless headphones\" into the Amazon search bar, and found a lot of choices. Most of the results were far beyond my means, as I am on a fixed income, and it is also the end of the month. But the constant throbbing of the bass right into my physical form through my bedroom wall was starting to literally make me sick. Google the effects that constant low frequency sounds- even when these sounds are not audible- have on the human body. These kind of sound waves are not good for human health, especially in the long term. Needless to say, I felt very vindicated after reading the findings of these scientific studies.\n\nThe reviews for the Soundcore Anker Life Q20 headphones were predominantly positive. The review that really encouraged me to go for it was the one mentioning the work colleagues who seemed to possess no indoor voices, and who constantly and loudly discussed basketball results et al at the top of their lungs without a care as to who they might be bothering with the volume of their voices. I could totally relate to that story. I used to work in a call center, where you made your living by being on the phone, so you needed to be heard by clients, and you needed to hear who you were talking to. This call center had an open floor plan, so we were in low-walled cubicles, but if someone stood up and shouted, even if they were on the other side of the room, you would hear them clearly from where you were. I found that I was surrounded by the kind of people who thought that yelling across the work floor to a distant friend about the softball game their kid had played the previous evening, while they were standing basically right next to me while I was on a call, was perfectly ok. These people weren‚Äôt adults. They were like giant toddlers, with no filter. Many of them were in their late forties and early fifties. When I later would ask them- politely- to be more cognizant of their volume level of their voice, as I was attempting to do my job, they became outraged. The nerve of me, to attempt to request they be considerate of their co-workers! Lol. So reading that these headphones had helped in that situation (I wish I had had them when I had been working at the call center) right then and there I thought that's it- I am ordering these headphones, and right now.\n\nAnd I am so glad I did! I was happily surprised, as they are not expensive headphones, at their ability to block out ambient sound. I usually run a white noise soundtrack in the background when I am home. I had turned it on automatically this morning, and started answering my emails. I hadn't realized I had boosted the volume on the white noise a bit too much, as I had put on and fired up my new Anker headphones before switching on the receiver. I took the headphones off for a moment to adjust my hair at one point, and was amazed, as the white noise was playing far too loudly- far louder than I would ever play it. Had I been using my regular J Lab wireless earbuds, I would have heard that it had been turned up too much right away. I actually dashed into my bedroom to turn down the receiver, as I felt bad for MY neighbors!\n\nAs far as the subwoofer- so far, I (knock wood) haven't been able to hear it. At all. I have had the headphones and the white noise going in my bedroom, and I took a break from my work (I work from home) after lunch to read ,and hang out with the kitties. I didn't hear any boom boom boom at all. I had heard them playing the stereo earlier, when I had been wearing my regular earbuds, so I am happy to report that these Anker headphones really appear to be helping.\n\nThe headphones were delivered this morning, so I can't attest as to their long-term performance, or their performance under various conditions (if they turned up their stereo up extra loud, my wearing the headphones without the white noise running, etc.) but so far, I am VERY satisfied with their performance. I was shocked at how fast they charged, and I have been wearing them for hours, yet they are still showing a full charge. They are comfortable to wear. I have a regular sized head, and I am picky about over the ear headphones. A lot of them give me a headache: these, so far, have not. They are nice and snug, so they keep the ambient noise out, but are not excessively tight. I actually fell asleep during my after lunch break hanging out with the cats, which is unusual for me to do with over the ear headphones.\n\nCons: the instructions for the controls for the headphones are rendered in a ‚Äúcartoon‚Äù style, so that was a bit odd, but not too difficult to figure out. The max volume is pretty good, and I like my headphones to get loud. I don't usually listen to music on headphones. There is a \"bass boost\" feature (a hard to understand voice sort of croaks \"bass up\" when you push the button with the triangle on it between the up/down volume buttons, and \"normal\"- I think that's what it says- when you turn the extra bass off) but this feature doesn't seen to make a huge difference. It does make voices sound richer and fuller. --Ok- I just tested the headphones with music. I chose to play \"Wardance\" by Killing Joke, as I know that song well, and yes, the \"bass up\" feature does make a noticeable difference. But as far as music goes- these headphones, for an old punk like me, would need to get a LOT louder, when playing music, for my taste. But that is a subjective thing, and I really didn't buy them to play music, but to listen to podcasts and to watch movies and YouTube stuff, and of course to block out that *&^%$!! subwoofer.\n\nI've only had one phone call while wearing the headphones. I wasn't crazy about how the other person sounded- they sounded kind of \"tinny,\" and distant- but according to them, they could hear me clearly. So I guess they work fine there, too. ‚ÄîEDIT: I have taken other phone calls with these headphones on after that one initial call. The voice on the the other end at the beginning of the call was a bit crackly, but this happens often with my carrier. After a few moments on the call, I could hear the caller perfectly. I make and receive calls with these Anker headphones all the time now. I always begin the call by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing a new headset- I just want to make sure- can you hear me ok?‚Äù I am always assured that I can be heard just fine. A friend of mine, who is used to my cheaper earbuds on our calls, has told me repeatedly that my voice sounds much clearer on our calls with these headphones.\n\nPROS: these headphones are the fastest charging electrical anything I have ever owned- period. It's actually kind of freaky how fast these things charge. It's great. They also hold a charge the longest amount of time of any electrical thing I've ever owned. I wore them all night to block out the thump thump of the subwoofer and, after six or seven hours of sleeping, I checked their charge level on my iPhone. Their battery level was still showing as a solid green circle meaning- they were still at, or nearly at, 100% charge. That's impressive.\n\nOne of the reviews mentioned these headphones don't come with an ON/OFF switch. They do. Left and Right headphone ear cup side orientations are marked inside the ear cups with an \"L\" and an \"R.\" The power switch is on the Left side cup, right above the \"NC\" (noise canceling) switch, which I always leave switched on. Volume Up and Down, and the triangle-marked button, the Bass up or down switch, are located on the Right side cup.\n\nTheir Noise Canceling capability is VERY impressive, given their low price point. There are times when I can *just barely* hear the bass from next door. But really- it's negligible, compared to what it was. I'm also going to take some other steps to help deal with this situation, but until then, these headphones have given me back the ability to have some nice, unbroken sleep, which is worth its weight in gold.\n\nI will update my review if something drastically changes regarding the performance these headphones. But right now- I am really happy I ordered these. I placed my order around midnight, and Amazon got them to me at around noon the next day. I'm really glad of this, as not having to endure that subwoofer- let's just say these headphones arrived just in time to save my last nerve.\n\nI am happy with the purchase of these headphones, and highly recommend them. Thank you.",
            "UPDATE: Added the 5th star. Read the review with edits at the end.\n\nWow. I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.\n\nI do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous. I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.\n\nWithout question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers. The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive. The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great. My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.\n\nAfter a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year. I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?! Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.\n\nLet me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.\n\nI like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable. I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great. MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!\n\nPairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy. After that, I put on my go-to sound check song (\"Sacrilege,\" by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.\n\nI have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care. The \"silent note\" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately. The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.\n\nThe highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.\n\nSo I tested the ANR. I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again. The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys. I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys). THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.\n\nWith Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys. Period. It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.\n\nIn terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere. I mean it. They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR. They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8\" jack.\n\nSound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies. I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application. If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away. If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.\n\nThat's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.\n\nThere are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.\n\n1. The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears. Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight. It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in. If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.\n\n2. The battery life isn't that great. To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them. However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without. My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48. Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.\n\n3. They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs. This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have. Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).\n\nHope that helps you make a decision. I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.\n\nUPDATE January 2023: After using these headphones for a reasonable amount of time, I'm adding the 5th star. The earphone cushions did \"break in,\" which I'm not crazy about (if it breaks in, it will break out), but they did become more comfortable. Ordinary movement is sufficient to avoid the urge to move the head phones. On a 3 hour flight, they're perfectly fine. When they are new, the cushions are a bit stiff and I should have realized that, because my AT's needed their cushions replaced after umpteen years.\n\nBattery-wise, I am getting pretty close to advertised spec, but I have noticed that if you crank up the volume on your phone or player, then crank up the volume on the headphones, the battery life suffers dramatically. Play with it a bit, adjusting device volume and then headphone volume until you get good sound without noise.\n\nFinally, I'll tell you that I like these so much that I bought a BT card for my PC. These are pretty good for videoconferences, and they're nice to have while you run a buzzsaw or have screaming children next door and you just want to not be distracted. I'll still prefer my Sennies for mixing, and I still prefer my AT's for ordinary focused PC work, but these cans are exceptionally good. I cannot get over how good they are, affordable or not.\n\nFive stars. When they wear out, or break, or otherwise stop making me smile, I'll just go buy another set.",
            "The sound quality and adjustments are best. They might seem price but are worth it. Have been using them for a year and have used them in gym, while running on track, indoors as well.\nOnly thing is that the cotton on both ears has now started to tear off after a year's use.",
            "Ich habe die Soundcore Q20 Kopfh√∂rer jetzt seit ca. einer Woche. Dabei sind mir folgende Vorteile aufgefallen, auf welche ich nun n√§her eingehen m√∂chte:\n\n‚Ä¢ Akkulaufzeit\n‚Ä¢ Klangqualit√§t\n‚Ä¢ Komfort\n‚Ä¢ Aussehen\n‚Ä¢ Stabilit√§t/Verarbeitungsqualit√§t\n‚Ä¢ Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung\n\nAKKULAUFZEIT:\nIch habe die Kopfh√∂rer t√§glich von einer Stunde bis zu 3-4 Stunden am St√ºck verwendet und sie geben einfach nicht nach. Der Akku ist noch am gleichen Stand wie beim Ersten Tag. Es ist erw√§hnenswert, dass der Akku bei eingeschalteter Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung viel schneller leer wird, da sie tats√§chlich AKTIVE Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung haben und mehr Energie verbrauchen (logisch). Ich muss Anker daf√ºr loben, dass sie diese Kopfh√∂rer als 40 Stunden haltbar vermarkten, da diese Laufzeit genauer ist, wenn die Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung EINgeschaltet ist. Ohne Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung k√∂nnen sie problemlos mehr als 60 Stunden halten. Es ist immer toll, wenn eine Firma etwas unterbewirbt und mehr liefert.\n\nKLANGQUALIT√ÑT:\nDiese Kopfh√∂rer klingen viel besser, als sie es in dieser Preisklasse sollten. Ich w√ºrde mich nicht als Audiophilen bezeichnen, aber ich habe Erfahrung mit den Bose SoundLink Over-Ear oder den Apple Airpods Pro. Abgesehen davon, dass sie etwas mehr Bass haben, als ich mir w√ºnschen w√ºrde, erledigen diese Kopfh√∂rer einen ausgezeichneten Job dabei, B√§sse, Mitten und H√∂hen in so ziemlich allem hervorzubringen. Nichts klingt ertr√§nkt oder √ºberbelichtet. Ich habe diese Kopfh√∂rer haupts√§chlich f√ºr Multimedia-Konsum (Filme, Videospiele, Musik usw.) gekauft. Sie haben genau die richtige Menge Punch im Tieftonbereich, um Dinge wie Explosionen oder basslastige Soundeffekte wirklich zum Leuchten zu bringen. In diesem Fall macht der st√§rkere Tiefton Sinn. Stimmen klingen kristallklar, da die Mitten nicht von den Tiefen oder H√∂hen erstickt werden, wie bei einigen teureren Kopfh√∂rern‚Ä¶ Die H√∂hen sind meiner Meinung nach das Highlight dieser Kopfh√∂rer. Viele Budget-Kopfh√∂rer neigen dazu, sehr \"blechern\" zu klingen, mit scharfen, harten H√∂hen, um den √ºberm√§√üig ges√§ttigten Bass auszugleichen, aber diese schaffen es gut, sowohl die Mitten als auch die H√∂hen ausreichend prominent zu halten (trotz des kr√§ftigeren Basses).\n\nKOMFORT:\nIch habe im Laufe der Jahre viele Over-Ear- und On-Ear-Kopfh√∂rer besessen und verwendet, und ich kann hier nicht drumherumreden: Diese sind die bequemsten Kopfh√∂rer, die ich je benutzt habe. Ich hatte erwartet, dass ich sie \"einspielen\" muss, basierend auf dem, was einige andere Bewertungen sagten, aber sobald ich diese aufgesetzt habe, war ich angenehm √ºberrascht, wie weich und leicht sie sich anf√ºhlen (ohne billig oder wackelig zu wirken). Und ich trage eine Brille!\n\nAUSSEHEN:\nEs gibt nicht viel zu sagen √ºber das Aussehen dieser Kopfh√∂rer. Ich w√ºrde nicht sagen, dass Sie damit auf der Stra√üe Aufmerksamkeit erregen werden, aber f√ºr den Preis, den sie kosten... Ich sage nur, sie h√§tten viel schlimmer aussehen k√∂nnen. Ich habe Kopfh√∂rer gesehen, die dreimal so teuer sind und die komplett unansehnlich sind. Die Q20 sehen sauber und minimalistisch aus, ohne ihren niedrigen Preis preiszugeben.\n\nSTABILIT√ÑT/VERARBEITUNGSQUALIT√ÑT:\nObwohl ich meine Ger√§te nicht grob behandle (egal wie wenig sie kosten m√∂gen), muss ich sagen, dass diese √ºberhaupt nicht schwach wirken. Ich habe einen milden Belastungstest gemacht, indem ich beide Ohrmuscheln so weit auseinander gezogen habe, wie ich mich wohl f√ºhlte, und konnte etwa 10 Zoll Breite erreichen. Ich glaube nicht, dass jemand einen Kopf hat, der so breit ist, aber wenn Sie das tun, werden diese definitiv passen. Die Verarbeitungsqualit√§t f√ºhlt sich gro√üartig an, und ich habe das Gef√ºhl, dass diese definitiv eine Weile halten werden (und ich werde diese Bewertung aktualisieren, wenn sich das √§ndert, haha).\n\nGER√ÑUSCHUNTERDR√úCKUNG:\nDiese Kopfh√∂rer haben tats√§chlich eine aktive Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung, ABER... ich benutze sie buchst√§blich fast NIE. Hier ist der Grund: Sie brauchen es nicht. Die Kopfh√∂rer sind so konstruiert, dass sie auch ohne aktive Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung eine Menge Umgebungsger√§usche ausblenden. Leider gibt es einen signifikanten Lautst√§rkeabfall, wenn die Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung aktiviert ist. Der Bass nimmt ebenfalls ab, was ihn gleichm√§√üiger mit den Mitten und H√∂hen macht (was f√ºr einige von Vorteil sein k√∂nnte).\n\nFazit:\nEs gibt eigentlich nur einen \"Nachteil\", den ich nicht erw√§hnen wollte, und das ist die Tragetasche, die mit den Q20 geliefert wird. Es ist eigentlich nichts daran auszusetzen, aber ich wollte nur erw√§hnen, dass sie fr√ºher mit einem harten Tragekoffer geliefert wurden (laut einigen √§lteren YouTube-Bewertungen), und ich bin ein wenig ver√§rgert, dass wir neuere K√§ufer den nicht bekommen. Alles in allem, f√ºr die 30 Euro im Angebot, die ich f√ºr diese Kopfh√∂rer bezahlt habe, f√§llt mir kein Grund ein, sie nicht uneingeschr√§nkt zu empfehlen. Sogar f√ºr den Normalpreis von 60 Euro, ist der Preis komplett gerechtfertigt. Sie klingen gro√üartig, die Akkulaufzeit ist unglaublich lang, sie sehen ordentlich aus, sind solide verarbeitet und sie haben sogar eine aktive Ger√§uschunterdr√ºckung f√ºr Situationen, die nach etwas mehr Stille verlangen. Also wie gesagt, absolut Top",
            "Very impressed with these headphones indeed - even though I'm a long-time fan of Anker products, I wasn't expecting them to be so good for the price! (¬£30) Excellent sound quality, very comfortable, great bluetooth distance from device, fold up fairly small, not too heavy. Really well made and premium-feeling, considering the price. Combined with the Brave browser on my phone to block youtube ads (free!) and provide lock-screen audio, my dog walks are a lot more interesting - and they keep my ears warm on cold days!\n\nMy only grumble is that the UI is a bit fiddly with various combinations of button presses and holds to change settings, but I'm slowly learning it all. Basic operation is easy, and the Noise Cancellation works well, so it's no big deal. If you're not worried about brands and just want a good, cheap set of headphones, go for these!",
            "Apr√®s avoir eu diff√©rents casques (Taotronics 90 et Mpow H21) dans cette tranche de prix je n‚Äôai gard√© que celui-ci. Je peux affirmer que le soundcore Q20 life est le plus √©quilibr√© de tous. Tout d‚Äôabord la r√©duction de bruit est la plus efficace compar√© aux 2 autres et de loin! Le H21 avait le pire ANC.\nLa qualit√© de son est excellente pour les 3 (sous certaines conditions concernant le H21)\nLe Taotronics 90 un poil plus charnus au niveau des voix, le Soundcore q20 un poil plus spatial et le Mpow H21 √©quivalent au Taotronics 90 √Ä condition de d√©sactiver la r√©duction de bruit !! Lorsqu‚Äôon active l‚ÄôANC le son devient tout de suite plus petit! vraiment dommage..... En revanche le micro du Mpow H21 s‚Äôen sort un peux mieux que les 2 autres.\n\nPour conclure le soundcore Q20 est vraiment le meilleur rapport qualit√© prix. D‚Äôabord parce que la qualit√© du son est top et digne d‚Äôun bon casque et parce que l‚ÄôANC est vraiment bon. Bien meilleur de ce qu‚Äôon peut trouver dans cette fourchette de prix.\nMa femme poss√®de √©galement un Bose QC35II et le Soundcore Q20 n‚Äôa pas √† rougir en terme de ANC et de qualit√© de son.\nEXCELLENT üëåüèª",
            "I love my anker headphones I got for my jogs outside. Great sound and amazing noise canceling feature. After about a month of using them, every time I jogged/jumped the sound started to crack. I contacted anker and Justin at customer service promptly sent directions to reboot. The reboot initially worked, but problem reoccurred within a week. I contacted Justin again and this time he sent me a brand new pair of headphones, which I received within a couple of days.\nBest customer service ever!"

            "I wasn‚Äôt sure I needed another Alexa device in my life, but I also wasn‚Äôt sure I needed a new coffee maker until I tried one, so here we are. The Amazon Echo Pop with Alexa has officially earned a permanent spot in my home‚Äîand I‚Äôm actually mad I didn‚Äôt get it sooner.\n\nFirst, the sound. I was shocked at how clear and surprisingly full the sound is for such a compact speaker. It doesn‚Äôt just play music, it fills the room without making me feel like I‚Äôm listening to a tin can. No, it‚Äôs not a full surround sound system, but for the size and price, it‚Äôs incredibly impressive.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about the looks. The Echo Pop has this sleek, minimalistic design that blends seamlessly into any room. It doesn‚Äôt look like some gadget that screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to take over your life,‚Äù but more like ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm here to help you with whatever you need, and I look adorable doing it.‚Äù\n\nAnd, of course, it‚Äôs Alexa. So, whether I‚Äôm asking for the weather, setting timers, or controlling the smart lights, Alexa responds quickly and reliably. It's like having a personal assistant who doesn't judge you for asking the same question 12 times (like when the UPS package will arrive).\n\nBut here‚Äôs where it gets fun: We‚Äôve set up a routine with Alexa that automatically plays music when the dogs start barking. It‚Äôs like Alexa becomes our \"bark interrupter\"‚Äîwe get a little peaceful music playing while the dogs realize the barking isn‚Äôt necessary. Honestly, it‚Äôs the best use of tech I never knew I needed. Plus, it‚Äôs a nice little bonus to get the tunes rolling during those random barking bursts.\n\nWhy I love it: ‚Ä¢ Great sound quality for the size‚Äîfills the room without being overwhelming. ‚Ä¢ Easy setup, like every Alexa device I‚Äôve ever had. Plug it in, connect, and you‚Äôre good to go. ‚Ä¢ A sleek, stylish design that actually fits into any space without being obtrusive. ‚Ä¢ Alexa! Need I say more? It‚Äôs like having a mini tech genie at your command. ‚Ä¢ And the best part: our barking routine. The music starts up when the dogs get too loud. Genius.\n\nVine Team, if you‚Äôre looking for reviewers who can talk about both smart tech and the fact that this little thing has a surprisingly fun personality‚Äîlook no further. I‚Äôve got dogs, music, and a soft spot for gadgets that actually work.",
            "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5 stars)\n\nI've been using the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) for a week or so now, and it has truly transformed my smart home experience. The design is sleek and modern, fitting seamlessly into any room. The sound quality is impressive for a device of this size‚Äîrich bass, clear vocals, and a good volume range make it perfect for music, podcasts, or voice commands.\n\nThe Alexa voice assistant is highly responsive and versatile. I use it daily to set reminders, control smart home devices, ask for weather updates, and even get news briefings. The integration with other smart home products has been smooth, allowing me to control lights, thermostats, and locks effortlessly.\n\nSetup was straightforward via the Alexa app, and the device recognizes my voice commands quickly. The microphone array is excellent at picking up commands even from across the room, and the privacy features, like the microphone off button, provide peace of mind.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Amazon Echo (4th Gen) to anyone looking to add a smart speaker to their home. It‚Äôs a great combination of functionality, design, and affordability.",
            "The Amazon Echo Pop is the perfect little smart speaker with a big personality! I got it to use in a smaller room, and it‚Äôs been fantastic. The sound quality is surprisingly rich and clear for its size ‚Äî great for music, podcasts, and even voice responses from Alexa.\n\nSetup was super simple ‚Äî just a few taps in the Alexa app and it was ready to go. Alexa responds quickly and accurately, and it easily connects to smart devices around the house. I use it for timers, weather updates, smart lights, and more, all hands-free.\n\nThe design is sleek and compact, so it fits perfectly on a nightstand or shelf without taking up space. It adds a nice modern touch to the room and comes in fun colors too.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a small but mighty smart speaker for your home or office, the Echo Pop is a great choice. Affordable, functional, and fun ‚Äî highly recommend!",
            "I picked up the Echo Pop in Midnight Teal, and I‚Äôm honestly impressed with how much this little speaker can do. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit anywhere‚Äîmine‚Äôs on a small shelf in the kitchen‚Äîbut the sound quality is still crisp and clear, with surprisingly rich bass for the size.\n\nAlexa responds quickly, even with background noise, and it works great for everything from setting timers to streaming music or controlling smart devices. I also really like the color‚Äîit adds a nice pop (no pun intended!) to the room without being too flashy.\n\nSetup was fast, and the whole experience feels polished. Amazon clearly put a lot of thought into making this a great budget-friendly smart speaker.\n\nI‚Äôd love the chance to try and review more Amazon devices. I enjoy giving detailed, honest feedback, and the Echo Pop shows just how much Amazon keeps improving its tech‚Äîeven in the smallest packages."

            "I've only ever owned Android phones and Windows PCs. I have a Windows gaming laptop and a Windows desktop at home. I bought Pixel Bud Pros instead of Airpod Pros, and I plan to buy either a Samsung or a Pixel smartwatch instead of an Apple Watch. But as for tablets, I avoid Android and Windows like the plague. So I picked this iPad up on sale, and I've never once regretted it. It's a solid, fast tablet, even though it's using the older A16 chip from the iPhone 14 lineup. Reading eBooks, ordering lunch, doomscrolling, playing games, obviously it can do them all. Battery life is stellar and it even comes with a charging brick in the box with cable. Whatever bad decisions Apple have been making with their phones, they've avoided a lot of them with their iPads, and that's why I would recommend one to anyone. Maybe go with the 256 GB model though, I've found myself limited by what games I can install on the 128 GB model.",
            "The Apple 11-inch iPad with an A16 chip, Wi-Fi connectivity, and 128GB of storage is a powerful and versatile tablet that appeals to both casual users and professionals. It's super light weight & perfect for traveling or on the go.\n\nI‚Äôve been using this iPad for a few weeks now & I‚Äôm really so impressed. I bought the blue which is so pretty likewise the other color choices. It‚Äôs super fast‚Äîapps open instantly & everything runs smoothly. The screen looks amazing with bright and vibrant colors, & its perfect for watching shows or editing photos. Bought a pen which works perfectly with it also.\n\nThe battery lasts all day without a problem, even with heavy use whether its working, studying, streaming or gaming.\n\nIf you‚Äôre thinking about getting a ipad, it's a great choice. I totally recommend it. Worth every dollar. Would recommend over & over again.",
            "Several years ago, I purchased the 10.9-inch Apple iPad, and like its predecessors, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. As someone who has worked with a variety of laptops, desktops, tablets, iPads, and Macs over the past two decades, I have found this device to be an excellent choice for personal use. I opted for what I consider the most comfortable and adaptable option, albeit one of the more expensive models. Given my limited use of the iPhone, I conduct approximately 95% of my internet browsing, social media interactions, emails, and research on my new 11-inch Apple A16 iPad from 2025.\n\nThe size difference between the two models is negligible, yet I have enhanced my experience by pairing the iPad with an affordable keyboard that transforms it into a more efficient typing device, as I find the on-screen keyboard quite unsatisfactory. As a baby boomer at 63 years old, I appreciate the convenience of being able to use the iPad to make phone calls and send texts to my contacts, allowing for seamless communication. Additionally, I can easily stay in touch with my grandchildren who live out of state.\n\nI have consolidated my four email accounts‚ÄîYahoo, Gmail, iCloud, and AOL‚Äîinto a single app, streamlining my communication. I can also set up various applications, including online college courses, without any issues. Although this purchase was a significant expense after just a few years‚Äîapproximately four, if I recall correctly‚Äîthe daily usage justifies the investment.\n\nThe snap-in keyboard is adjustable to various angles, remains stable, and adds minimal weight to the iPad. Its dual function as a cover provides excellent protection against drops from considerable heights, which I find to be a significant advantage. The color of the iPad and the keyboard/cover complement each other beautifully; the blue hue of the iPad is particularly aesthetically pleasing, especially for those who favor that color.\n\nI appreciate the upgrades and was pleased to find that transferring data from my old iPad to the new one took less than ten minutes. After organizing some personal settings‚Äîsuch as disabling Siri, which I do not prefer‚Äîupdating apps, and making cosmetic adjustments like resizing icons on the home screen and cleaning up photos, I felt satisfied with my decision to upgrade.\n\nI chose to make this transition during a period of downtime in my life, and while the process was neither challenging nor time-consuming, I am eager to explore new features. As I navigate my chemotherapy treatment, I find myself with ample time to utilize this device effectively. While the physical size difference is minimal, the improved typing speed, increased storage capacity, and overall experience have made me grateful for this upgrade. I highly recommend this Apple iPad and the specific model I have selected to meet my needs.***the color of his iPad is a pearlized cornflower or sky blue. It is quite beautiful and my phones camera did not do it justice i these photo‚Äôs. The color they show you on the webpage is much closer to the real color but until you see it in person, you can‚Äôt even imagine how lovely it is.",
            "This iPad is so fast, I half expect it to brew my morning coffee before I even tap the screen. The A16 chip handles everything from streaming to multitasking with the grace of a ballet dancer and the speed of a cheetah on espresso.\n\nThe 11-inch Liquid Retina display is a visual treat‚Äîcolors pop like confetti at a New Year‚Äôs party, and the clarity makes me question if I‚Äôve been watching videos in standard definition my whole life. Ôøº\n\nBattery life? All-day, as promised. I binge-watched an entire season of my favorite show, took notes, doodled questionable art, and still had juice left to scroll through memes before bed. Ôøº\n\nTouch ID is snappy and reliable, making me feel like a secret agent every time I unlock it. And the Wi-Fi 6 ensures my connection is as stable as my obsession with this device. Ôøº\n\nIn short, this iPad doesn‚Äôt just meet expectations‚Äîit surpasses them with a wink and a smile. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their tech game. Ôøº",
            "The laptop my mom gave me is actually about 15 years old! I didn‚Äôt know until I had to search for a new battery for it (last year) and the battery I bought was probably only a few months old and it‚Äôs already telling me that the battery is low plus my laptop I gave to my stepfather (because it stopped working) like 4 years ago and he still hasn‚Äôt given it back to me so lol‚Ä¶ just like that I bought my FIRST ever iPad.\nIt‚Äôs beautiful! The package was secured, no damages, no issues so far.\nMy guardian angels gave me the green light to buy it and I have no regrets!\n\nAlso in case you guys are wondering, the iPad DOESN‚ÄôT come with a pen and keyboard. I bought those separately."

            "I‚Äôve been using the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus (2023 release) for a few weeks, and it‚Äôs been a fantastic upgrade for my home security. The Head-to-Toe HD+ Video in 1536p gives a crystal-clear, wide view‚Äî66% taller than the older Ring Video Doorbell 2nd Gen‚Äîso I can see visitors and packages from top to bottom. The Color Night Vision is a game-changer, letting me spot details even in low light, like when the delivery guy drops off a package after dark. Setup was a breeze; I connected it to Wi-Fi through the Ring app and mounted it with the included tools in under 15 minutes, no hardwiring needed thanks to the Quick Release Battery Pack.\nThe motion detection with customizable zones is super handy, alerting me to people or packages while ignoring passing cars after some tweaking in the app. The Two-Way Talk feature lets me chat with visitors or scare off porch pirates from my phone, and the Quick Replies are great for when I‚Äôm busy. With a Ring Home subscription, I get Package Alerts and video storage for up to 180 days, which is worth it for reviewing footage, though you can still use Live View and real-time alerts without it. Some users mention battery life varies (mine‚Äôs lasted about a month with moderate use), and occasional Wi-Fi drops can happen, but I‚Äôve had no major issues. For anyone wanting a sharp, reliable video doorbell, this Ring model is a solid choice! Adjust motion settings and check Wi-Fi strength for best performance.",
            "Good product overall. It was a bit unclear, but you can connect the battery Ring to your existing doorbell electric wiring and it will provide power to keep the battery charged as well as trigger your house ringer if you have one for where you live. The image quality is very good, especially when it goes into night mood which I didn't know it would do. You need a wifi to connect the Ring to and a subscription to record/save videos. If you don't have a subscription, you can still use the live features, just not all the fancy bells and whistles. There are tiers to the subscription so you can select what works best for you. All in all, I am happy with the product. Very easy to install.",
            "I‚Äôve been using the Ring Doorbell for a few months now, and it‚Äôs made a noticeable difference in how secure and connected I feel at home. Installation was surprisingly simple‚Äîeven for someone who‚Äôs not particularly handy. The instructions were clear, and the app guided me through every step.\n\nThe video quality is sharp during the day, and the night vision works well enough to clearly see visitors after dark. I especially like the motion alerts, which notify me any time someone approaches the door. This feature has been great for monitoring package deliveries and deterring unwanted visitors.\n\nThe two-way audio is also a standout. I can talk to delivery drivers or even ward off suspicious people without opening the door. The app integration is smooth, and I like being able to review recorded footage if I miss an alert.\n\nMy only minor gripe is that the motion sensitivity can be a bit touchy, sometimes triggering for passing cars or dogs. But after a bit of tweaking in the settings, I got it to a comfortable level.\n\nOverall, the Ring Doorbell has been a solid investment for peace of mind and home security. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade their front door with smart tech.",
            "First time having a doorbell with a camera. IT WORKS!! Subscription not required but is useful for retrieving previous occurrences happening at your front door. Night vision works great and audio is clear! Definitely suggest one!! Oh it's waterproof too.",
            "A+ for camera quality and wifi streaming. Night vision is excellent. BUT.\nI installed this unit the day I received it and the actual features and build quality of this Ring doorbell unit are much better than the Blink unit I‚Äôm replacing. Where it almost lost me was at the install.\nThis unit comes with a wedge style plate that you can use as a template for drilling into almost any surface if you have a general idea of what you‚Äôre doing. I replaced my existing original door bell with this unit as a test to see if I liked it in that area enough to warrant eventually hardwiring it in. I have a brick veneer that I really didn‚Äôt want to have to drill into but glad Im glad that I did. Ad I found out after drilling new anchor holes that the supplied screws for the anchors were definitely not going to work for this install. The heads are wayyyyy too small for the slots of the accompanied wedge plate. If you don‚Äôt plan on tightening them down then the doorbell will sit loosely attached to the wall and will definitely slide around when the bell button is pushed. Which, might suite someone, sure. It was just such an odd short sided but major component of the install that I was having second doubts about the entire experience. But after finding an appropriate sized set of screws in my own ‚Äúmisc screws kit‚Äù the rest of set up and testing experience went smoothly. This is really the only negative aspect of this Ring unit. Which for the current price, one might think there would be sufficient quality testing of all components of this item before mass production.\nAlso I would def recommend checking out some YouTube vids under the exact name of this doorbell as it‚Äôs listed. If you generalize it too much then you‚Äôll be watching the wrong install videos. P.s. for those having a hard time with the wedge mount, the plate should face you with the screw holes facing you during the wall mount sequence. Upon mounting that portion to your wall or door, then remove the battery compartment and look for 4 screw holes on opposite sides of the battery. Those are the only 4 you need to screw to the plate for it to sit firmly in place. Also kinda weird that this isn‚Äôt plainly described or pictured enough in the printed or digital instructions imo.\nTldr: doorbell quality and functionality seem leagues ahead of mounting kit and parts.\n\nI‚Äôll eventually post photos soon to hopefully help others in my same boat.",
            "As will all Ring products, this battery powered Ring Camera Doorbell is great. Bought it for my sister in law who lives in a condominium. Easy to set up and works great. She loves it.",
            "great solid unit easy to use works well",
            "Excellent product. Battery lasts a couple of months. Battery is easy to charge and charges in a few hours.",
            "The video doorbell at my front door, has been and fantastic addition to my home. Very sensitive, and nothing escapes detection at my door and close proximity. Very clear videos, even at night. Even when I'm away from home shopping etc., the doorbell alerts me of any movement at my door. I can also talk to people at my door, when I'm away from home. All in all, a must for home security.\n\nSince writing this review, the free recording of data has expired, and I'm now required to pay an annual subscription to keep the recording going. After paying good money for this item, I consider it an insult to have to pay more to use this item. Frankly I'm sorry I purchased this item now, and consider it a piece of worthless junk.",
            "It was easy to install and get working. The product works well and has a great viewing angle for both people and parcels. It has gone offline once for no reason; however, I can live with that if it's only once. One improvement would be to fix the geofence bugs. It doesn't work consistently and notifies me that I am at the door when I am leaving the house, which is annoying. I have mine hooked up to Chime Pro and have subscribed to the Protect plan. I would buy it again."

            "I recently purchased the AuxLink USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter to connect my hearing aids to my smartphone, and it has exceeded my expectations. The adapter features a high-quality DAC chip that delivers clear and distortion-free sound, which is crucial for hearing aid users. Its durable nylon braided cable and polished alloy connectors ensure longevity and a premium feel. The adapter is plug-and-play, making it incredibly easy to use without any additional software or drivers. It's compatible with a wide range of devices, including iPhone 15, Samsung Galaxy S21, and more. Overall, this adapter provides excellent sound quality and build, making it a valuable accessory for anyone needing to connect hearing aids to USB-C devices",
            "These save me so much hassle at work and traveling. It‚Äôs so small and it hardly takes up any space and it‚Äôll fit in any pocket. It connects to those normal headphones then to those new pesky(ish) usb c devices.",
            "Great to have this adaptor. I like to use over the ear wired head phones. This makes the dream a reality. Thanks!",
            "This 2-pack of USB-C to 3.5mm audio headphone adapters is a must-have for anyone using newer smartphones or tablets like the Samsung Galaxy series (S21-S24, and presumably future models like the S25), Google Pixel, USB-C iPads, and the USB-C equipped iPhone 15 (and potentially future iPhones like the mentioned iPhone 16 if they continue with USB-C). As many devices no longer feature a dedicated headphone jack, these dongles bridge that gap, allowing you to use your favorite wired headphones or aux cables. üéßüì≤\n\nThe \"HiFi\" claim suggests these adapters aim to deliver good audio quality, likely incorporating a decent Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). Getting two in a pack is excellent value, providing a spare or one for a second device.\n\nWhile the compatibility list is very broad and includes future speculative models (a common practice for generic accessories), they should generally work well with most devices supporting audio output via USB-C. As with many third-party dongles, durability and the true \"HiFi\" experience can sometimes vary, but for their core function and convenience, they are incredibly useful. A practical solution for an everyday modern tech need. üëç",
            "When I got a new phone, my older Bose wired headphones would no longer work with the new phone. This usb-c adapter to headphone jack worked perfectly. The connection is secure and the quality seems sturdy. It fits great, gives me a solid connection and now I‚Äôm back to watching Netflix on airplanes!",
            "Works as intended on my iPhone 16 pro. Simple to use and connects easily.",
            "Works great! I can now connect my iPad to my monitor speaker for playing with JamZone!",
            "This little adaptor works pretty well. I use it for my iPad. There has been only one glitch with it in that I can‚Äôt use it on FaceTime calls. For some reason the other person can‚Äôt hear me. Other than that, I‚Äôve been happy with it. I am, however, very impressed with this company. I received an email from them not long ago asking how I liked the product. I explained the issue I was having with it, so they sent me a fix to try. Since it didn‚Äôt work, they refunded me. I didn‚Äôt even ask for the refund, but they stand behind the product and are trying to make it better. I‚Äôve honestly never seen customer service like this. I hope they‚Äôre able to fix the glitch; I‚Äôd definitely buy again if they do.",

            "I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but these wireless earbuds really impressed me. The sound quality is excellent ‚Äì music, calls, podcasts, everything sounds clear and sharp. The noise-cancelling mic is a nice bonus too. I‚Äôve taken a few calls while walking outside, and the person on the other end could hear me just fine.\n\nThey‚Äôre super comfortable to wear. The little earhooks keep them in place, even when I‚Äôm running or working out, and they don‚Äôt hurt my ears after a while like some others I‚Äôve tried. Plus, they‚Äôre waterproof, so no worries if I get caught in the rain or sweat a lot at the gym.\n\nPairing was super easy ‚Äì just opened the case and they connected right away. No hassle at all. The connection stays solid and doesn‚Äôt drop, and I love that I can move around the house without carrying my phone with me.\n\nBattery life is amazing. I can use them for hours without charging, and the case holds a bunch of extra charges too. The fast charge is a lifesaver ‚Äì just 10 minutes gets me about 2 hours of use, which is great when I‚Äôm in a rush.\n\nTouch controls work great ‚Äì I can change the song, adjust the volume, or even call up Siri without touching my phone. Really handy when my hands are full or I‚Äôm on the move.\n\nOverall, I‚Äôm super happy with these earbuds. They do exactly what I need and more. Totally worth the money and perfect for everyday use or workouts. Highly recommend!",

            "I definitely didn‚Äôt expect these earbuds to be better than my Beats!! I‚Äôm definitely keeping these in my car instead of my Beats. The noise cancellation was excellent. I couldn‚Äôt even hear my grandbaby talking to me lol. I also like that when I called someone they said, I didn‚Äôt sound like a robot didn‚Äôt sound like I was underwater. I wasn‚Äôt muffled. I was very clear and they were very clear as well. I could hear them real Good. I definitely didn‚Äôt expect electronics under $30 to be this good. It didn‚Äôt take long to get 100% charge from being zero. They are lightweight and good for working out bc there is a piece that goes over your ear in case you sweat a lot it won‚Äôt fall out! They were very comfortable and all my functions can be done from the earbuds, smart watch or smart phone. I just got them but they seem durable (I dropped the case twice and the buds didn‚Äôt fall out!!",
            "These are great quality, they don't hurt my ears to wear them for a long time.\nThey don't fall off real easy and are actually comfortable. They are really easy to operate, with touch and solid button controls, for volume and media selection, on each ear piece. The sound quality is great and voice clarity from the noise canceling function, is better than expected. They connected to my device by Bluetooth, right away and auto connect as soon as i remove them from the charging case. They last several hours, almost all day in fact, before needing only a few hours to charge, in the charging case, which will charge several times before needing charged itself, using any usb c charger. All functionality is great."

            "Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with the Blink camera system (and I‚Äôm not paying for the subscription). One of the reasons I decided to buy into this system was because I didn‚Äôt need a subscription for: 1) Live view option, which means, see the live video from the cameras any time I want via the app, from anywhere. 2) Save videos that were triggered by motion to a USB flash drive (memory stick) inside my house (not cloud only and not stored in the camera itself). Keep in mind, most of my comments here will be related to using the system without a subscription, but I‚Äôll comment on the differences where possible. Also, my comments may be a little more technical than most people would like, but for anyone interested, I‚Äôm being as detailed as possible :-) These comments are relevant as of Feb 2024 (the date I wrote this review).\n\nViewing/Storing Your Videos: During the trial subscription period when I could view my motion-triggered saved videos in the cloud, I noticed the videos load/play quicker than if you‚Äôre accessing the videos stored on the USB flash drive in the Sync Module 2. Anyway, not a big deal, but it‚Äôs a difference. You need to provide a USB flash drive to plug in to the Sync Module, but those are very cheap these days and a 128GB drive will give you TONS of storage for videos since the file size of the videos is not very big. Also, with the cloud subscription there‚Äôs a thumbnail for each video saved, which can be helpful in finding important videos if you‚Äôre trying to find one with people in it, rather than a video triggered by a dog. Without a subscription, there‚Äôs no thumbnail on the saved videos which you view in your app, and it takes several seconds for them to load/play in your app, but it‚Äôs bearable. The nice thing is, if you don‚Äôt have a subscription, the videos save to your flash drive/memory stick in the Sync Module 2 immediately after the recording is finished. If you have a subscription, the videos only download to your Sync Module‚Äôs USB flash drive once per day, at night (as I understand it).\n\nSync Module 2 & Wireless Signals to Wi-Fi & Cameras: The Sync Module is required for the cameras, but you get one of those if you buy a package, like I did. I bought the bundle that included two Outdoor 4 cameras, one video doorbell and the Sync Module 2. It‚Äôs important to know the Sync Module and the cameras have TWO wireless signals. One that needs to connect to your home (or business) 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network and one that is only for use by the Sync Module and cameras and that signal is a ‚ÄòLow-Frequency Radio‚Äô (LFR) signal. It does not have 5GHz, but you don‚Äôt want that anyway because the 5GHz signal is weaker than 2.4GHz signal. The Sync Module is where you connect a USB flash drive (memory stick) to save your videos if you‚Äôre not paying for a subscription (and also for once-daily backups of your videos if you ARE paying for a subscription). PLACEMENT OF THE SYNC MODULE IS IMPORTANT! Remember, it has TWO signals. It needs to be placed in an area that has a good signal to your home/business Wi-Fi AND so that it also has a good signal to all your cameras (if you have them spread out in different areas around your home or outside your home). To give you some perspective, my house is a single-story ranch style house (around 1,700 sq ft) and I have a camera outside on each wall (each wall is brick). I was able to place the Sync Module and my Wi-Fi access point in the center of my house. Even in this central location, I have one camera (the video doorbell, about 38‚Äô away from sync module and Wi-Fi access point) that has only 2 to 3 bars (out of 4) for the Wi-Fi connection but usually 4 bars for the Sync Module connection. Long story short, make sure you place the sync module, your Wi-Fi access point and the cameras so they all connect to each other with as strong a signal as possible for best performance/reliability. It worked out well for my house, especially since I have flexibility on where I can place my sync module and home Wi-Fi access point and the technical knowledge and tools to move it wherever I needed it.\n\nOutdoor 4 Camera: The image quality/exposure for these cameras is very good. The nighttime IR (infrared) view is very good also (it will appear like black and white footage). The coverage of the IR light when it‚Äôs dark is also very good and has better coverage than I would have expected. I have motion-triggered flood lights outside my house anyway, so if my lights are triggered, the camera may not use IR because it sees enough light (at that point it will record normal video in color just like it does during daylight). I bought 25 ft long third-party USB-C cords with a power supply to use as the power source for my Outdoor 4 cameras so I never have to replace batteries and so I can view live video from the cameras as much as I want and also have the infrared light set to High without impacting battery life, because there are no batteries to worry about :-). I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs different WITH a subscription, but the longest period you can record when the camera is triggered by motion is 60 seconds. For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds, just so you know. Regarding the power, I drilled a hole in the bricks of my house (in the mortar actually) to feed power to my Outdoor 4 cameras. One camera is directly under a soffit, so there‚Äôs no danger of rain getting in there where the power cord connects (but the cord I bought is weather sealed anyway, not a normal USB-C cord). The other camera is mounted under a third-party security camera cover to keep the sun from beating down on it all summer (it‚Äôs on a south wall) and to keep rain off it, just in case‚Ä¶because again, I decided to power this one by a cord that plugs into the back of the camera instead of using the batteries). The included mount is very nice and flexible. If you mount an Outdoor 4 camera under a white security camera cover like I did, you may need to paint the underside of that cover with flat black paint because at night (in my case) the infrared light reflected off the underside of the cover/shield I‚Äôm using over my outdoor 4 camera and that made the video made difficult to see clearly. Daylight videos were unaffected, it was just at night in low light when the IR light was active for video recording that was a problem with that aftermarket cover I bought.\n\nDoorbell Camera: For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds. Why, I don‚Äôt know. Technical limitations? The Outdoor 4 cameras can record 60 seconds of motion triggered video. The wireless signals for the doorbell camera seem to be a little weaker than the outdoor 4 cameras. One big disappointment is that the video doorbell camera can NOT be powered by your existing doorbell power wire. My old Skybell brand video doorbell CAN be powered by the doorbell wires, so it‚Äôs a bummer that Blink can‚Äôt do the same. You can connect your existing doorbell wires to trigger your indoor doorbell, so that‚Äôs good‚Ä¶but like I said, you can‚Äôt use that wire to power the video doorbell. I confirmed this with Blink tech support. I hope they have a new version in the future that is able to be powered solely by the doorbell power wires, but for now, I have to keep batteries in it. The video doorbell device has a weaker infrared (IR) light than the Outdoor 4 cameras and lesser quality video than the Outdoor 4 cameras, but overall, it‚Äôs good (especially during daylight hours). The included mount is very nice and easy to install.\n\nMotion Triggering of Videos + Privacy: The settings/customization for when motion triggers video recording is very good. You have the option to block out as much of the scene as you need to to prevent unwanted triggering of video recordings, such an area of the scene where tree limbs often blow around or something like that. For privacy, you have the option to block out 2 custom size areas in the scene you select for privacy reasons so that area in the video is grayed out. The selected privacy area does not trigger when motion happens in that privacy section and also, when other sections in the scene that you allow to be seen trigger video, the video that's recorded has a gray box in the privacy section (all you see is a gray box). That's pretty powerful and useful, if you need it. Regarding motion triggered video recording in general, I've noticed the cameras can accidentally trigger (record) when it's really misty/foggy outside. If there's a lot of mist in the air floating by the motion sensor, it can trigger a recording. Just something to keep in mind because you may need to adjust the motion sensitivity and/or 'disarm' the cameras for a while until the mist clears because you may be getting lots of unwanted/accidental recordings. I have mine adjusted to the point where the cameras almost never accidentally record unless it's very misty outside, which isn't too often where I am.\n\nAudio Quality: The microphones on the Outdoor 4 and video doorbell camera pick up sound very well. I can clearly hear anyone speaking. The closer they are, the better of course, but it's very good. The speaker volume for the cameras is very good as well. It's plenty loud and if anyone is nearby when you activate the camera and start speaking, they'll hear it clearly :-)\n\nBlink App for Phone: The app you can download on your phone for managing the cameras/sync module is very nice and has plenty of options to configure/customize the cameras (motion settings, video quality, audio settings, check status, etc). The app is where you view your videos, but of course if you‚Äôre storing videos on the flash drive connected to the sync module, you can remove that flash drive and plug it in to your computer to see the video files there or make copies of the files for long-term storage‚Ä¶but of course you can also use the app to save a video file to your phone if you want to keep a copy of share it with someone, like the cops :-). I wish they had an app for Windows so I could view the cameras live and see saved videos on the sync module‚Äôs flash drive right from my computer, but at this point there‚Äôs no PC app. I think there used to be one?...but if there was, there isn‚Äôt one now (Feb 2024).\n\nPrice: I compared the price of this system and what it can do with other systems like Ring, Nest and Skybell and at this time, the price difference is significant, in my opinion. The Blink system (and what it offers even without a subscription) is better than the other systems I checked out.",
            "Just received this today, and it does show an improvement on the quality. Feels and looks beefier. When updating your activity zones, there are more squares to select than the previous versions of these cameras, which I like, to fine tune the areas I want. ** And, I think the inactive zones you set up, are ‚Äòactually‚Äô enforced and work as expected than the older generation cameras.\n\nTIP **25 September 2023 - For those having issues about wifi signal strength, you may need to mess with the router‚Äôs settings to increase signal power. If your router is between walls, behind the tv, etc. you will see degradation in performance and responsiveness in live view. I have a gaming router set on a high shelf, because routers work best when they‚Äôre in a high spot. My cameras that are outside have no issues with Wi-Fi strength and are responsive when live-viewing.\n\nField of view has improved significantly and you can see a large difference between versions of cameras.\n\nGood thing is that the mounts for the previous cameras WILL work on this camera. The mount it came with is an improvement to previous versions. Flat base, not cone-shaped.\n\nI‚Äôm currently trying the person detection from the trial with this camera, and will update over time on the performance.**Person Detection since having BO4 as the trial, has been great! It has significantly cut down on the amount of unwanted notifications caused by wind, car/sensor lights, animals, etc. I do feel that you can save battery life significantly, even when the sensitively is set higher. Having too many notifications does get annoying at times, but I think Blink is definitely making an initiative to make these camera a gamer-changer, while still maintaining ease of setup.\n\nPrice is a tad high, but you may consider the monthly payments, which I did.\n\n**28 August 2023 - Taking a snapshot/photo capture from these cameras, at night, non-night vision, pointing in a lighted area is sharp(er), than any previous version. No images included due to security. Haven‚Äôt tried night vision alone, but I‚Äôm confident the same sharpness is applied.\n\n**29 August 2023 - The Motion Recording Types cover Person Detection and All Motion. I have one camera set with Person Detection enabled with sensitivity level at 8, and it didn‚Äôt detect me driving my car in/out of the garage. I would‚Äôve thought Person Detection would encompass ‚Äòsome‚Äô normal motions, but I think we must take it at face value that when set to Person Detection, it will ONLY detect persons, you don‚Äôt get the best of both worlds unless selecting All Motion. Sounds dumb to say, but though I‚Äôd make it aware. Update** On a ‚Äòvery few‚Äô instances, this camera did detect my car entering and exiting our garage. So my thoughts originally have shifted, but I think over time with continued firmware updates, it will hone in on its accuracy.\n\n1 September 2023 - One camera fell offline/unresponsive. Suspicion is on firmware updates being applied, or, weather factors since it‚Äôs low 60¬∞ outside. No issues with home network or signal strength to camera. Will continue to monitor/self troubleshoot. **I took out the batteries, and tested them, showing still a full charge/health, and placed them back in, bringing the camera back online.\n\n4 September 2023 - One of my BO4 cameras with Person Detection enabled was at level 8 sensitivity, and on a windy day, did alert that there was a person at (insert camera name). It alerted a few times during the day (under 5 instances), but not a big deal. My guess would be that as BO4 continues to develop, the accuracy will improve in its detection.\n\n8 September 2023 - Setup of 3rd BO4 camera set in an area where there is minimal/no lights. Due to security, no images. Taking Live Photo with the IR intensity set at LOW. Some haziness/fuzziness but the area is lit up, and provides better detail than previous versions of Blink cameras. As you increase in IR sensitivity, the Live Photo (in HIGH IR setting) increased in sharpness and reduces glare and fuzziness significantly. **I placed some solar floodlights in the area of this BO4, and with low IR sensitivity and once the lights are triggered, the video capture was much sharper than previous versions of Blink cameras. I only have video quality set at normal, so I‚Äôm impressed with BO4 so far!\n\n28 September 2023 Another BO4 fell offline around 11pm. Last occurrence was due to a firmware update being deployed, so this may be due to the same thing.\n\n1 October 2023 - Installed my 4th BO4, as I‚Äôm looking at all the point of views both in the live shot and live view, it feels that it elongates everything. I know my driveway isn‚Äôt that long, but comparing it to previous generation cameras, BO4 view appears to add like 20ft+ to my driveway. I can understand the other reviews concerned about the range detection, as I do notice some times it will not catch movement, especially if I‚Äôm moving slowly or based on camera positioning, but at sensitivity level 8-9, I would like to catch movement at a farther range. As I continue to implement BO4, I will continue to observe performance.\n\n6 October 2023 - It appears one of my BO4s point toward the road at max sensitivity IS NOT catching cars passing by anymore. Seems that v13.34 that was pushed out, affected the range despite any setting changes. Not a concern (yet), but I‚Äôm hoping newer updates will fix range issues and sensitivity. **Update - camera seems to be capturing movement now at a lower sensitivity set at 6-7. May‚Äôve been a change in traffic flow by the house, in which there may be less cars, however, will continue to observe BO4 performance.\n\n4 November 2023 - Installed another BO4 camera while also upgrading one camera with a battery expansion kit. This is specifically for BO4 cameras, not previous versions. The expansion makes this camera much heavier, however, the mounts they come with (and previous) will support the weight without the mount drooping/moving. I‚Äôm not a fan of adding more bulk to the camera. Also, this battery expansion will not use camera‚Äôs battery slots, and instead uses the expansion for 4 batteries. I would‚Äôve preferred an integration that would‚Äôve retained the two onboard batteries + two for expansion. Other than that, the BO4 cameras have been wonderful to use, with overall quality/sharpness. I do hope that future updates will improve motion detection and range, respectively. Nonetheless, these are worth an upgrade from previous versions.\n\n15 November 2023 - I‚Äôve noticed recently that BO4 will notify of Motion/person and it will not record that instance. It happens sporadically, so it is a slight concern, but not enough deter me from purchasing another BO4. Over time as more updates are pushed to these cameras, I expect the overall effectiveness will improve.\n\n6 December 2023 - BO4 has been a great upgrade for my system. There are still occasions where I‚Äôll receive a notification of movement, but does not record that moment. It‚Äôs very rare now with the update to v13.41. I still see issues regarding the sensitivity not working as expected. One camera is set at 9, toward the road, and it does not always catch cars driving by. Not a showstopper, but I can see now it‚Äôs range detection could be an issue for others. With recent Blink app updates, you now can adjust the length of video recording (previously it was adjusted by every 5 seconds), which is great! Allows for better customization for your needs. I wish this was the same for the sensitivity (0-99 vs 1-9). Overall BO4 has been accurate with Person Detection, and the subscription for Blink Plus for $10/mon, is very reasonable for any household to use to expand features.\n\n27 January 2024 - BO4 has been working exceptionally well. I still have the Blink Plus subscription to allow the Person Detection feature, and it‚Äôs accurate. There were certain instances that BO4 cameras did not record movement such as my neighbor chopping his tree down. I also noticed there were connectivity issues during that time that left a large gap in my list of recordings. Not a showstopper, but concerning for those security moments. Range also plays a factor in detection, so I continue to hope that future updates will improve this. Overall, upgrading to this camera is well worth it. Wait for the sales to get these at a cheaper price.\n\n16 February 2024 - Decided to update the Blink Sync Module because I realized I was still using the 1st generation sync module. I updated to the 2nd generation sync module, and I noticed there‚Äôs more of a delay when live streaming my cameras. I did a reboot of the sync module a few times, but I still receive a slight delay. One camera I have at a longer distance is unable to be live viewed despite Wi-Fi and sync module connection have full bars/strong connectivity. Still attempting to troubleshoot but I think something about the firmware I updated to since it‚Äôs the first time connecting. Further investigation is needed. Overall, the cameras are working as expected!\n\n18 February 2024 - Identified that the issue was NOT the Sync Module 2, and rather my own internet. Reboot modem, router and network switch, and saw significant improvement in BO4 camera responsiveness. Additionally, I will take into factor that weather was not great at the time of incident. Since this, the Blink cameras are working as intended!\n\n22 April 2024 - I‚Äôve bumped up to the yearly Blink Plus subscription as the Person Detection feature has been wonderful! Eliminated unnecessary notifications caused by wind, sun/shadows, or other movement. It does save your batteries!\n\nThere are occasions where there is a notification of movement, however, it does not record/save the video. Not sure if there are delays, but I continue to have confidence as new firmware is pushed to BO4, it will improve overall performance. Since having these cameras, I haven‚Äôt had major issues, and Blink support have been helpful and receptive.\n\nOther things I‚Äôve noticed as far as delays in live streaming, are caused by your upload speeds. The higher your upload speeds are, the quicker the response is. Additionally, consider adjusting your Wi-Fi strength from your router/wireless access point, as this also contributes to the responsiveness.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with Blink Outdoor 4 cameras.\n\n8SEP2024 - BO4 Cameras have been great! When pairing it with the Blink subscription for cloud storage and the Person Detection feature, it‚Äôs helps with cutting down unnecessary movements caused by animals/shadows/etc.\n\nOccasionally, I would still receive Blink app notifications for movement, but it will not record it. Not sure if this is still an ongoing bug, or late push notifications from previous captures, but it doesn‚Äôt impact my rating for the product.\n\nI wish detection sensitivity was improved or expanded upon to allow for timely capture of events.\n\n10 April 2025 - Since my last update, BO4 continues to meet and exceed my expectations for a quick and easy setup for a camera system. While WiFi signal strength is not a concern for my cameras, it is something to think about for your best setup for these cameras. While there is a new Blink Sync Module XR which expands range, I have not used it for my setup.\n\nI‚Äôve changed/upgraded all my cameras to BO4, and I‚Äôve very pleased with the battery life, and the Person Detection feature to minimize recordings caused by animals, cars, lights, etc. Person Detection still needs a bit of work because a few times, it would detect deer, and notify me it‚Äôs a person. May be a deal breaker for some people, but, overall person detection is pretty accurate."

            "Kindle vs Boox Palma\n\nLove this thing!\n\nThe 2024 Kindle Basic is probably the best e-reader you can get *at this price*. but to be honest, if I bought it again, I'd probably spend an extra $45 for the Kindle paperwhite.\n\nThe battery life is incredible‚ÄîI easily get 50 days between charges, which blows my mind. It‚Äôs lightweight, easy to read on, and does the job well if you just want a simple, reliable reading device.\n\nThat said, I do wish it had a blue light filter for nighttime reading, and after using my Boox Palma 1, I realize how limited the Kindle is in terms of customization. I use the Boox way more because of how flexible it is.\n\nIf you‚Äôre just looking for the basics and unbeatable battery life and reliability, this is the one. But if you want more control over your reading experience, definitely look into Boox Palma 1 or the Kindle Paperwhite for the blue light filter.",
            "I have only had this for about a week. It is fairly close to the simplicity of my old kindle keyboard. I just wanted a device I could load books on to read and not need a computer science degree to use it. I take grandson's to college credit classes and spend a lot of time waiting since they don't yet drive. This little kindle is a perfect size to slip in my purse or in my computer bag. It has two choices for the lighting of the screen. I really like the dark setting as I can read at night and don't need to turn on a light. You can see the screen and read easily but it is not bright enough to wake up my husband. Since I was getting a kindle but didn't know which one my daughter waited and then ordered a screen protector and a carrying case for my Mother's Day gift which I would highly recommend for it. Even with the case it is very light weight.",
            "It‚Äôs honestly been a good two years since I‚Äôve sat down and genuinely read a book‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶Too long! When I saw this kindle in the shop (the matcha green one) - I was a little hesitant at first. Like why do I need an ebook if I can just order hard covers or paperbacks? But this thing is tiny and mighty! I‚Äôve probably charged it once a month, and I get to read before bed by using the black light option. It‚Äôs perfectly tiny where I can just hold it in one hand - and read even laying on my side! Perfect for falling asleep to a good story! The matcha green color is also super cute and not distracting! I used to have trouble focusing when I sat down to read large hard-covers but somehow this kindle helps me read more than I have ever read in my LIFE!",
            "I have to admit I was not sure I would be OK with a small screen. My husband reads his Kindle books on his phone and I just can‚Äôt. So I thought this was getting very close and had trepidation. However given the price point, I really wanted to give this newest Kindle a try for two reasons. Arthritis in my hands and travel.\n\nI use a mini iPad for most all of my Kindle reading, primarily because I love the page turning feature and like the option of being able to jump to other options‚Äîmessaging or the Amazon app etc. if I just quickly want to, while reading. Also because I love full color for home page and certain art books and other selected books.\n\nHowever, while small, it is a bit heavy.\n\nThis new Kindle is just right and light. I love it. I can put this in my purse and it‚Äôs not going to weigh it down. Something very important to me as well. It‚Äôs so slender too. I would get that clear cover though, that helps with the grip, and does not add to the thickness.\n\nThe screen is so crisp. I am a 67 year old who has had cataract surgery but still have floaters.\n\nSo the screen, brightness, crispness and the ability to comfortably hold the device is important to me. Knocked all of those out of the park as well. I can hold this thing for hours and even with arthritic hands not feel pain. I don‚Äôt need to rest it on anything while reading and that‚Äôs a game changer.\n\nI am of course aware I can change the font, but I didn‚Äôt want a screen so small I‚Äôd have to make the font so large I‚Äôd get only a paragraph per page. I find that this size is like a better, brighter paperback book where I can slightly tweak the font to perfection giving me that book experience which also is important to me.\n\nPage turning is instant. Perfect.\n\nBattery is a workhorse. Best yet. Hours later still at 90% which I have NEVER had on any device using it even with moderate use.\n\nThe photo shows the size of my mini iPad on the left. So while the size difference isn‚Äôt that much, the weight is.\n\nI own other much older Kindles. A Kindle Fire. An IPad. And various other electronics including other digital readers I really like. For travel. For going to a Dr.‚Äôs appointment, for just taking this with, hands down, this is the best. I LOVE it and didn‚Äôt think I would so much! I love it so much I‚Äôm using it more and more around the house even though I prefer full-color on my home page and the page animation!"

            "I saw several complaints about the sound quality, and \"You'll need a soundbar or some kind of external speaker(s)\", but that wasn't the case at all. The sound quality on this TV actually isn't bad at all. That was the only thing holding me back from purchasing it, so I didn't have very high hopes going in. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Not that it sounds right up there with the best or anything like that, because it doesn't and it isn't, but the average user shouldn't have any problem with the sound quality straight out of the box. The picture quality is equally as surprising. It's a 1080p TV, so don't expect mind blowing clarity, but for what it is and what it costs, it's really nice, and with all kinds of settings that I've never heard of. I actually did very little in the way of setting this thing up. I remember reading somewhere just a few days ago that Vizio TVs are factory preset to the taste of individual countries that they ship them to, and after reading that, it made sense to me why there was very little adjustment necessary. LOL I think I spent more time getting it out of the box than I did making adjustments. Setup was a breeze. It found my Wi-Fi immediately, I put my password in to get it connected, and inside of a few seconds, it was ready to go... or so I thought Naturally, the first thing it wanted to do was install a bunch of updates. Doesn't everything anymore? After downloading, installing, restarting, installing, restarting, installing, restarting, I was finally ready to do a channel scan. Yeah, I got cable TV out of my life over 20 years ago, and I haven't missed it one bit. The scan took three to four minutes and brought up like 48 channels. I'm still working on this input called Watch Free, and as near as I can tell, it's kind of a mix with your station presets and other select material probably based on those stations. In the 3+ weeks since delivery, I haven't experienced one flaw, lockup, random restart, random power down, glitch or hiccup out of it.\nThere are a few little things about it that I'm not too thrilled about, namely the complete lack of RCA inputs, only two HDMI inputs, and when inputting channels on OTA TV using the number pad, it brings up an on-screen numberpad, but instead of intuitively hitting the center button, you have to use the arrow down to navigate to an area at the bottom of the on-screen keypad, and when you get to the correct tab, THEN hit the center button. Next, arguably the most used controls on the remote, the channel and volume keys... Why do they all now place those keys so low on the remote? Those keys are way down near the bottom to the point that you don't really have any room to hold onto the remote. The remote is also narrow, thin, short, and VERY slippery. Overall, I guess it's ok, but a universal remote is probably in my near future. As the title says, keep your expectations reasonable, and you shouldn't be disappointed. If you want a TV that performs like a $1000+ set, then go spend $1000 on a set, and you'll be just fine. As far as its current price tag of $138 is concerned, you're getting a LOT of TV for your money.\nEDIT:\nAt almost two months in, I've been able to integrate it into my entertainment needs without much of any learning curve, and I'm still happy with my purchase.",
            "This smart tv has a home screen that is connected to your Internet for streaming but also uses an air antenna or cable too. They recommend shows and movies from free streaming or for whatever service you are subscribed to including Prime if you are an Amazon member. There are options where you elect different standby modes and/or direct access back to where you left off so mine returns to prime automatically which is my usual preference. It even has the capability to play audiobooks or Hoopla. I'm very happy with the quality of the picture and all the options though it took me a little while to figure it all out mostly because I'm a senior citizen not great at tech but was able to figure it out",
            "Set up is easy and picture quality is very good so far. One complaint voiced by others is the screws for the leg attachments do not screw in properly and it takes a good deal of effort to get a tight fit. Also note the screw heads are small and you will need a very small screw driver to fit properly.\nIn addition the included smart apps included you can also easily use Apple play to stream a full array of apps using your iPhone or iPad. It‚Äôs also compatible with Roku if apple play is not an option. Sound is decent for a built in system Haven‚Äôt used the headset feature but nice that it‚Äôs there when you want quiet for those around you. A good value for size.",
            "I bought this to use for Karaoke. The video projector where I do karaoke is down and I don't know when it will be up again. I used my old 32 inch flat screen in place of the projector but it's heavy, 34 pounds, I already have enough heavy equipment to carry-in as is. I decided to permanently not use the projector so I bought this flat screen. It's 40 inches and only weighs just under 19 pounds, it's feel like picking up a plastic box full of air. So far it's working great. It's a pretty minimal tv, no buttons, you must use the remote. It has two HDMI, antenna, USB for ARC, and will connect to WIFI to be a smart TV. It pretty much has most things that a person would want. It does remember how it was set up when the power is killed so I don't even need to take the remote with me when doing karaoke.",
            "Got this TV just to play my PS5 on while I‚Äôm on vacation and it works perfectly the HDR makes the darker areas look great on the game. The picture quality is entirely better than I thought it would be. It was very easy to set up and the remote control easy to use and have some great features. The WiFi connects great once it‚Äôs set up, haven‚Äôt had an issue yet. It is actually the perfect size for a medium size bedroom also. The sound quality isn‚Äôt great but not bad, I find myself turning it up to 23-33 but it depends on the background noise as well at night usually 15-18 volume.",
            "This TV is lightweight and sets up fairly easily. The legs are very simple to install. The only issue I had was the initial set up process kept getting held up but if you just exit and set up and then reenter it went pretty quick after that. I've had a few Vizio's over the years and they are good TV's for the money.",
            "Yes 5 stars for this 40\" Vizio TV, Great Wi-Fi connections, was so easy to set up. I find the sound quality better than most TV in the 40\" screen size. I have had Vizio TV in the past and glad I came back to purchase another one. I have a 32: Vizio purchased in 2014 and it is still going strong and is used very day. you cannot go wrong with the entertainment value from Vizio",
            "I have many Vizio TVs and bought this one for a bedroom. The TV itself worked fine but the listing had the wrong information in it as far as the width of the stand feet, so it would not fit on the cabinet that we wanted. But we still kept it and moved it to a different wider cabinet. Just wish the sellers would make sure they are listing the correct information. When you're buying online, what else do you have to go by other than the description and the picture? But I highly recommend Vizio TVs. I have about seven."

            "Arrived on time in a sturdy shipping pkg. Legs needed to be attached which is usual; required a #1 philips screw driver, #2 was too large and could have stripped the screw heads so be sure to use a #1 philips. Color and sound is better than I expected for a TV in this price range. Remote is typical for what is on the market currently, no arrow keys rather a ring around a select button. Remote has buttons for Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Music. No buttons for Hulu, Sling or other major streaming services. I also needed to setup the TV so it was simple to use for my technically challenged wife to use as it is in her bedroom. I only wanted our streaming service on the main menu bar for her.\n\nPros: Set up was pretty automatic, I was lead step-by-step through the setup process; just answer the questions on the screen. Linking to my wireless home network was easy. Removing unwanted apps was pretty straight forward; just select the app and press the right \"mouse\" ring button on the remote to bring up a menu that appears on the lower right of the screen where you can select one of several options (hide or delete), use the same process to move apps to the main menu bar by using the \"front\" option.\n\nCons: Set comes with a ton of installed apps, most of which I had never heard of. Included a few of the major streaming apps: Amazon Prime, Halmark+, Disney+ and Amazon Music. However, other major apps such as Hulu, Sling were missing and difficult to download and install due to the lack of instructions; an online search lead to instructions for downloading/installing other streaming apps. I don't like the new remotes that do not have \"arrow\" keys but use a \"ring\" around the select button; very easy to push the select button when trying to push the ring. Configuring the main menu was annoying as I had to go through each installed app to hide, delete or move what I wanted to the main menu bar. I deleted every app I did not need except for those that Amazon will not allow to be deleted, had to hide those.\n\nAfter downloading and installing Hulu, our preferred streaming service, it suddenly disappeared and the only way I could get it back was to reset the TV to factory defaults and go through the entire setup process again. Then of course the process of hiding, deleting and moving apps to the main menu bar. After doing this the TV retained my setting.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this TV especially for the price, color and sound. Once I got it setup it is easy to use even for my technically challenged wife.",
            "My previous TV, a flat-screen gifted to me in 2011, already ready to go, died last week. All of my adult life I have made do with hand-me-down or used TVs/monitors.\n\nMy dead TV was set up in my office so I could watch TV while working on the computer. I fed the TV with a laptop, via HDMI. I had previously poured a giant glass of ice-water on the laptop so the screen doesn't work very well, which made it perfect for feeding the TV.\n\nI have large VOD libraries on both Prime Video and Vudu, so when looking at the Smart TV options, access to Vudu is important to me. So I originally decided against this TV because it's an Amazon Fire TV, and my Fire Tablet, (that I use to watch TV/movies in bed), doesn't allow me to put Vudu on it.\n\nBut when looking at all of the options, this one was the right size, and it does have HDMI inputs, so I could still feed it with my broken laptop, so it was the obvious choice, with the great sale price.\n\nI searched the apps and found that Vudu was an option. I also downloaded Peacock, Paramount+, Movies Anywhere, Tubi, Plex, Crackle, MSNBC, The CW, ABC, NBC, CBS, and YouTube. Signing into to each of them on my computer and using codes worked really well. So the only thing I had to actually type my password into using the remote was my Wifi. It all works great, and switching to the HDMI input is easy, if I ever want or need to do that. Like if I ever want to watch something I only have on DVD or Blu Ray.\n\nI will add Disney+, Hulu and Netflix when the WGA writer's strike is over and I resubscribe to them.\n\nI don't know if my previous TV was HD, but when I've visited my parents when they've played Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and other things in HD on their HD TV and it has all looked gross. The Battle of Helms Deep was a bunch of amorphous clay blobs, and the Death Star was a bunch of dudes in bad costumes hanging out. I don't know if that was the motion smoothing thing that Tom Cruise was mad about a few years back, Either way, I've seen none of that gross stuff.\n\nI've watch a little of the new Children of the Corn, several episodes of Stargate Atlantis, a little of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and Jurassic Park, and it all looks good. If I look closely I can see what I'm guessing is filmgrain, but the picture is clear.\n\nI recently watched an episode of Snoops (1999) that was uploaded to YouTube from probably VHS. There's a brief scene that features Dick Miller. I posted a screenshot to Twitter, but anyone who looked at that pic has to more or less take my word for it that it is indeed Dick Miller. But on this TV I could make guesses about the shade of lipstick worn by Teyla Emmagan, if I knew anything about lipstick.\n\nThis is all to let you know my level of knowledge so you can judge how my level of happiness would measure up to your level of happiness.\n\nMy only other observation in the few hours I've had this, is that the TV stands are at the outer edges of the TV. My previous TV had a big center stand, when meant I could perch it fairly near the edge of the table next to my desk, at a 45 degree angle (ish). So with the stands at the edges, I've had to push the TV farther back, and put sturdy things under the stands to give the TV better purchase on the table. Which is to say, you really need enough table under the entire TV to support it.\n\nI saw a review that said their TV didn't come with the screws for the stands. Mine did. They were in a separate small bad, the same way the remote batteries were in a separate bag.\n\nSo far the TV seems absolutely great.",
            "I live in a tiny house and had a 28 inch wall space that perfectly accommodated this 24‚Äù inch Fire TV. In my opinion there is nothing better than a fire TV. The installation and set up was a breeze. The remote is a great size and so easy to use. The TV has a nice quality picture, nice and sharp. You don‚Äôt have to press a bunch of buttons if I don‚Äôt want to, you can speak all of your requests. Simply hold down the one aqua button and say ‚ÄúNetflix‚Äù and you‚Äôre there in an instant. You can say show me Matt Damon movies and all his movies pop up. For the price you absolutely cannot beat this Insignia Fire TV. I purchased a 55‚Äù after this for my bedroom. Same thing, I love it.",
            "I bought this TV and couldn‚Äôt be happier. The picture quality is amazing‚Äîvibrant colors, great resolution, and perfect brightness at any time of day. The sound is also impressive: clear and loud even without external speakers.\n\nThe interface is fast and easy to use, and all my streaming apps work perfectly. I started using it right away with no issues, and now it‚Äôs the heart of my movie and show nights.\n\nDefinitely a great purchase. I highly recommend it!"

            "I bought a couple of these for an international flight and they are so great. They connect via Bluetooth to my headphones. Great! I don‚Äôt have to use the wired earbuds and I can use my big over-the-ear headphones.\n\nI also *have* to use over-the-ear big headphones because I need to use ‚Äòearplanes‚Äô to not have a horrendously uncomfortable flight (and hour+ after). With this little adapter, I can still listen to the in-flight movies and not be in discomfort thanks to my goofy Eustachian tubes/never-ending sinus problems.\n\nThis held a charge for two 8-hour flights (plus one shorter connecting flights) because I didn‚Äôt charge it at all from when we arrived until we left. There didn‚Äôt appear to be any audio lag when watching movies, so that was a pleasant surprise. I did bring the instructions with me to make sure I could pair it to my headphones (sometimes I‚Äôm dumb), and thankfully I had no issues pairing it to my headphones.\n\nBased on all the info, these can have multiple uses, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll be using them almost exclusively on long flights and I‚Äôm totally fine with that. Worth every penny and would buy again if I lose it or it stops working.",
            "This worked great on a Delta flight to Vegas - I was able to use my Apple Air pods easily. Quick point, and they do mention in the instructions that you might have to do this - I turned off my phone while I was pairing them as they seemed to get confused with trying to pair to my iPhone.",
            "I don‚Äôt usually get this excited about tech accessories, but the AirFly Pro 2 seriously blew me away. I used it recently on a 12-hour Delta flight, and I can honestly say it made the entire experience so much better. This little device is truly a game changer for anyone who flies and wants to use their own wireless earbuds instead of those uncomfortable airline headphones.\n\nSetup was incredibly easy ‚Äî just plug the AirFly into the headphone jack of the in-flight entertainment screen, press the button to pair, and within seconds my Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) were connected. No glitches, no weird delay in sound, and the audio came through crystal clear. Honestly, it even sounded better than I expected. I watched a few movies and streamed some music, and there were zero issues the entire time.\n\nOne of the best features is that you can connect two sets of earbuds at the same time. I was able to pair mine and my travel companion‚Äôs, and we both listened to the same movie together ‚Äî totally wire-free. It made sharing the experience so much easier and more fun, without having to deal with splitter cables or one-ear listening.\n\nThe battery life is also amazing. The AirFly was fully charged before the flight and lasted the entire 12 hours without needing a top-up. That gave me complete peace of mind, knowing I wouldn‚Äôt have to fuss with charging it mid-flight. Plus, it‚Äôs super compact and sleek ‚Äî it took up virtually no space in my bag and is now a permanent part of my travel gear.\n\nIf you travel at all, especially on long flights, I can‚Äôt recommend the AirFly Pro 2 enough. It‚Äôs absolutely worth the price, and once you use it, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever traveled without it. Huge thanks to the creators for making such a thoughtful, high-quality product. Flying just got way more comfortable.",
            "My computer bluetooth was no longer working, so I needed a bluetooth to audio connection adapter so I can continue to listen to music while working. This was one of the first products to show up, and seeing the reviews, it seemed like it works great, so I decided to order this and try using it.\nI do not regret it! First off it was easy to connect the first time to my earphones and plug into my computer. Easy to put away, especially because of its small size and little bag included. The sound is also great compared to my earphones originally with no static at all. Also to those wondering, it connects not only to Apple products but also any other earphones or headphones.\nI couple things to watch out for though, is that first off the sound would sometimes cut off and you would have to restart the AirFly device to reconnect the sound. Usually it disconnects on average (For me) about every 30 - 60 minutes when using for prolonged time. Also, sometimes the sound would start going a bit bad, and usually to fix it, I would have to restart my earphones to fix it. Although after using it for more times, the problem becomes less of a problem and occurs less often.\nOverall 4 stars for its usefulness, but also for its time-to-time problems.",
            "All our family members have one and is essential when we fly. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other reasons to purchase but ours was for flights. It was a little tricky to figure out at first but we got it now. Highly recommend especially if you travel and use wireless earbuds.",
            "The first time I used this I couldn‚Äôt get it to work and the jack for the tv on the plane in my seat was wonky. Just took it on another trip after syncing to my iPods before flying. Total game changer. Will never go back.",
            "Love this! I bought the AirFly SE specifically for long flights, but it‚Äôs been so useful I now bring it everywhere. Setup was super simple ‚Äî it paired with my AirPods in seconds. I used it on a cross-country flight with the in-seat screen, and the sound quality was perfect with zero noticeable lag.",
            "Have yet to try it on a flight but paired immediately with my AirPods Pro 2 and functions as described.",

            "I've only ever owned Android phones and Windows PCs. I have a Windows gaming laptop and a Windows desktop at home. I bought Pixel Bud Pros instead of Airpod Pros, and I plan to buy either a Samsung or a Pixel smartwatch instead of an Apple Watch. But as for tablets, I avoid Android and Windows like the plague. So I picked this iPad up on sale, and I've never once regretted it. It's a solid, fast tablet, even though it's using the older A16 chip from the iPhone 14 lineup. Reading eBooks, ordering lunch, doomscrolling, playing games, obviously it can do them all. Battery life is stellar and it even comes with a charging brick in the box with cable. Whatever bad decisions Apple have been making with their phones, they've avoided a lot of them with their iPads, and that's why I would recommend one to anyone. Maybe go with the 256 GB model though, I've found myself limited by what games I can install on the 128 GB model.",
            "The Apple 11-inch iPad with an A16 chip, Wi-Fi connectivity, and 128GB of storage is a powerful and versatile tablet that appeals to both casual users and professionals. It's super light weight & perfect for traveling or on the go.\n\nI‚Äôve been using this iPad for a few weeks now & I‚Äôm really so impressed. I bought the blue which is so pretty likewise the other color choices. It‚Äôs super fast‚Äîapps open instantly & everything runs smoothly. The screen looks amazing with bright and vibrant colors, & its perfect for watching shows or editing photos. Bought a pen which works perfectly with it also.\n\nThe battery lasts all day without a problem, even with heavy use whether its working, studying, streaming or gaming.\n\nIf you‚Äôre thinking about getting a ipad, it's a great choice. I totally recommend it. Worth every dollar. Would recommend over & over again.",
            "Several years ago, I purchased the 10.9-inch Apple iPad, and like its predecessors, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. As someone who has worked with a variety of laptops, desktops, tablets, iPads, and Macs over the past two decades, I have found this device to be an excellent choice for personal use. I opted for what I consider the most comfortable and adaptable option, albeit one of the more expensive models. Given my limited use of the iPhone, I conduct approximately 95% of my internet browsing, social media interactions, emails, and research on my new 11-inch Apple A16 iPad from 2025.\n\nThe size difference between the two models is negligible, yet I have enhanced my experience by pairing the iPad with an affordable keyboard that transforms it into a more efficient typing device, as I find the on-screen keyboard quite unsatisfactory. As a baby boomer at 63 years old, I appreciate the convenience of being able to use the iPad to make phone calls and send texts to my contacts, allowing for seamless communication. Additionally, I can easily stay in touch with my grandchildren who live out of state.\n\nI have consolidated my four email accounts‚ÄîYahoo, Gmail, iCloud, and AOL‚Äîinto a single app, streamlining my communication. I can also set up various applications, including online college courses, without any issues. Although this purchase was a significant expense after just a few years‚Äîapproximately four, if I recall correctly‚Äîthe daily usage justifies the investment.\n\nThe snap-in keyboard is adjustable to various angles, remains stable, and adds minimal weight to the iPad. Its dual function as a cover provides excellent protection against drops from considerable heights, which I find to be a significant advantage. The color of the iPad and the keyboard/cover complement each other beautifully; the blue hue of the iPad is particularly aesthetically pleasing, especially for those who favor that color.\n\nI appreciate the upgrades and was pleased to find that transferring data from my old iPad to the new one took less than ten minutes. After organizing some personal settings‚Äîsuch as disabling Siri, which I do not prefer‚Äîupdating apps, and making cosmetic adjustments like resizing icons on the home screen and cleaning up photos, I felt satisfied with my decision to upgrade.\n\nI chose to make this transition during a period of downtime in my life, and while the process was neither challenging nor time-consuming, I am eager to explore new features. As I navigate my chemotherapy treatment, I find myself with ample time to utilize this device effectively. While the physical size difference is minimal, the improved typing speed, increased storage capacity, and overall experience have made me grateful for this upgrade. I highly recommend this Apple iPad and the specific model I have selected to meet my needs.***the color of his iPad is a pearlized cornflower or sky blue. It is quite beautiful and my phones camera did not do it justice i these photo‚Äôs. The color they show you on the webpage is much closer to the real color but until you see it in person, you can‚Äôt even imagine how lovely it is.",
            "This iPad is so fast, I half expect it to brew my morning coffee before I even tap the screen. The A16 chip handles everything from streaming to multitasking with the grace of a ballet dancer and the speed of a cheetah on espresso.\n\nThe 11-inch Liquid Retina display is a visual treat‚Äîcolors pop like confetti at a New Year‚Äôs party, and the clarity makes me question if I‚Äôve been watching videos in standard definition my whole life. Ôøº\n\nBattery life? All-day, as promised. I binge-watched an entire season of my favorite show, took notes, doodled questionable art, and still had juice left to scroll through memes before bed. Ôøº\n\nTouch ID is snappy and reliable, making me feel like a secret agent every time I unlock it. And the Wi-Fi 6 ensures my connection is as stable as my obsession with this device. Ôøº\n\nIn short, this iPad doesn‚Äôt just meet expectations‚Äîit surpasses them with a wink and a smile. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their tech game. Ôøº",
            "The laptop my mom gave me is actually about 15 years old!

The package was secured, no damages, no issues so far.\nMy guardian angels gave me the green light to buy it and I have no regrets!\n\nAlso in case you guys are wondering, the iPad DOESN‚ÄôT come with a pen and keyboard.

However I also wanted to be able to listen to my music during that extended period of time doing my cardio and resistance workouts. I tried various 'ear-bud' types and I don't know if my ears are different from other folks, but for the life of me, I could not get them to stay in, keep a good 'seal' to maximize sound and minimize ambient gym sounds. Even sets that had received great reviews about staying in ears did not work for me and so I started looking for 'over-ear' style headphones.\n\nI happened on this product, noticing its low price-point, excellent reviews about quality of sound and ease of use. I tend to sweat quite a bit which was a concern prior to purchasing...how long will those ear pads last? Well, I've been using these for almost 3 months now and I'm not noticing any issues with them so far. They sound great, connect perfectly and stay connected w/my music source and the pads are not showing any worse for the wear. I wipe them dry immediately after use and let them air-dry at home.\n\nI'd prefer having a less bulky, more streamlined option for listening to music, but for me these are working out really well. And for the price paid, I'm not going to be out much money at all if and when they no longer work for me. I notice lots of people at the gym who seem to prefer over-ear headphones as well.\n\nIf you're needing a pair of inexpensive headphones, you may want to look these over.",
            "Not much of a review writer, but I spent days agonizing over buying these vs something more expensive. Hopefully this will help someone stress less üëç\n\nTLDR: Just try them. Get them as a gift even! These are far past anyone‚Äôs expectations of $20 head huggers!!!\n\nNow‚Ä¶ (for longevity, just know I‚Äôve had these since mid December and use them daily)\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nThese are so great‚Ä¶ hands down. They aren‚Äôt gonna blow you away as they are only $20-23‚Äôs, but I also have SkullCandy Crushers evo, Apple AirPod pro 2s, and random other wired buds and THESE are by far my favorite.\n\nPros:\n-1 I can wear these 24/7. They are feather light; not in a cheaply-made way, but in a very intentional way. I can actually FORGET I have these on. Really. The AirPods hurt after several hours or even start to slide out. My Crushers literally hurt just to put them on and I have a tiny head! But THESE!!! They are such a joy to wear!!!\n\n-2 The Bluetooth connection just WORKS! I cannot understand how THESE headphones accomplish this when Apple and SC cannot!\nApple pairs fine, but then randomly starts playing sound from another device all the time. Messing with settings is irritating and still it just starts playing audio from random iOS drives in the house! On the other hand, the Crushers have to be cleared in order to connect to a new device. Every time. I almost sent them back cause I assumed they were broke, but no. Apple struggles with it and you have to ‚Äúforget the device‚Äù every single time you want to say, go from your phone to an iPad (then back again). It‚Äôs madness. Some big brain thought this was a good idea.. These $20 ones; you power them on and BAM it connects and STAYS connected! If it doesn‚Äôt automatically connect, I just tap the name and it‚Äôs instant. ü§Ø\n\n-3 The mic is fantastic. I‚Äôve only used it in my home, but ppl tell me it‚Äôs crystal clear.\n\n-4 The easy eq on the side! No apps to download etc. just push it and it cycles through predetermined settings. And these settings actually make a diff. If you want to listen to an instrumental track, don‚Äôt leave it in ‚Äúbass‚Äù setting cause you will automatically think it‚Äôs the headphones and they are garbage. NO! Shame on you for blaming them lol\n\n-5 I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it as I‚Äôm not knowledgeable in audio devices (audiophile?), but what I also love about these is the spacial depth of sound. Some music just has the ability to surround you with these things in a way no other devices does. Even the AirPods with ‚Äúspacial audio‚Äù can‚Äôt seem to replicate these ‚Äúvast‚Äù atmospheric sounds at times. Of course this also relies heavily on the audio, but wow.\n\n-6 They fold so well. At first you might think, these things are flipping around everywhere and going to break.. nope. They just effortlessly fold in on themselves. I am rough on headphones too as a busy mom. They get tossed in my giant mom-backpack daily with no case or cover, squished between iPads etc and they are holding up like a champ!\n\n-7 I clean house in them for hours in the day and make/take calls as well. Not once have I received a low battery warning. They also have USB-C!!!!! For $20 I wouldn‚Äôt have expected that, and they charge incredibly fast.\n\n-8 The price. Omg the price lol I just spent more than $20 at McDonald‚Äôs.\n\n-9 They come packaged SO nice. It‚Äôs no iOS unboxing experience, but ordering anything online has me jaded lately. I fully expected these to just be in a plain box with some Chinese wording, with lots of bubble wrap, but no. It comes in a simple, well made, cardboard cube, but it has bright colors and a presentation value that‚Äôs hard to get online with cheap electronics.\n\n-10 the giant L/R on the inside! I never realized how many times I have flipped headphones and ear buds all around to figure out which was left ear and which was right. I never even knew I needed this in my life! It‚Äôs just another little detail that they didn‚Äôt HAVE to even bother with, but the details on these things seemed to matter to the designer and/or company.\n\nCONS:\n-1 They don‚Äôt get loud enough for me. Going from AirPods shooting sound waves into my ear canal and Crushers literally made to rattle from bass, directly to these can be frustrating as I have to just put them on max volume immediately. Is it a drastic volume issue? Absolutely not in my opinion. It‚Äôs just the ONE thing for me keeping these from being a god-tier S++++++ rating. Hell, this might even be considered a PRO feature, as I‚Äôm sure all my other devices are chipping away at my hearing one day at a time‚Ä¶\n\n-2 There IS no second con lol seriously.\n\nConclusion:\nI have a white pair, bought my husband the black pair and am about to purchase my teen a pair. THAT is how much I love these and why I just HAD to write a literal essay about the brand.",
            "Got these for a 12 hour plane ride and they worked perfectly!! The battery lasts SO long; didn't have to charge it on the ride at all and it lasted long after the ride as well. The sound quality is also super good, and they're comfortable as well! Fold compact and small so its easy to pack around. Bluetooth was also super easy to connect. Only complaint (aka reason for not 5 stars) is because the sound leaks a bit so other people can hear what you're listening to. On a plane it wasn't a problem since its so loud, but in a quiet environment it might be a bit more annoying.",
            "Comfortable over the ear headphones that I would highly recommend! I ordered these to replace a pair of Bluetooth headphones I left behind while traveling, and they have exceeded my expectations so far. More comfortable than my old pair, with a better fit and better noise canceling capability. The battery provides hours of listening time between charges, again with better performance than my previous set of Bluetooth headphones. Finally, the sound quality is very good, with a built in equalizer offering six presettings: Jazz, Rock, Vocal, Pop, Bass, and Classical. All for the same price as the older, more cheaply made pair. I was expecting a cheap, somewhat disposable product that I would be replacing in a year or so, but these seem very well made.",
            "Dentro de este rango de precios no esperes encontrar algo mejor. Hay auriculares parecidos a este por Amazon o competencia pero hay que encontrarlos y probarlos. Yo ya lo he hecho, as√≠ que no pierdas el tiempo y fiate de mi palabra. Son bastante buenos y no creas que hay una gran diferencia frente a marcas con rango de precio m√°s elevados que tornan los 70‚Ç¨. As√≠ que dales una oportunidad.",
            "Me cost√≥ mucho trabajo encontrar unos audifonos que tuvieran las 3 B (bueno, bonito y barato), pero al fin los encontr√©. La bateria dura mucho, no son exactamente las 36hrs, pero si es m√°s que el promedio de aud√≠fonos. La calidad del material se siente bien para lo que cost√≥ el producto y lo mejor es la calidad del audio. Los modos de ecualizaci√≥n son buenos aunque yo siempre uso el modo bass porque me gusta que suenen m√°s grave los bajos con la electr√≥nica. En resumen, es un buen producto."

            "My 10 yr old remote just stopped working, making it impossible to turn the tv on, change from cable to antenna and even the volume and mute didn‚Äôt work. My cable remote won‚Äôt work those functions on this old tv, so I was stuck for a week, unable to do anything, but change limited cable channels. I found this Vizio remote, with great reviews, so I bought it, hoping it really did work on my tv, otherwise, I‚Äôd need to buy a completely new one. To my pleasant surprise, it worked, right out of the box, with no programming needed. Being an old woman, I was dreading figuring out trying to program a new remote, or even a new tv. Thank you, Vizio, for making these after market remote! You made this old lady so very happy!",
            "My vizio TV remote has been falling apart slowly, and I held on to it for a while, until one day the tape and glue that I've been saving it with, just couldn't hold it together anymore. I found the same remote control on Amazon for a reasonable price. The buttons functionality on the old remote control was gone. I had to press two or three times before it works. This is what happens when you have big family at home. I used to have this TV all to myself because I was the only one who could handle the broken remote control. We have two other televisions in the house, but the vizio is the largest. Now my monopoly over the TV is gone because of the new remote control. This is a great remote control, and I am glad that the TV is back to a normal working condition again.",
            "I bought these remotes for my LG TV, my buttons on these remote (Original Remote) were wearing out so I bought these. They work effectively. The design of the remote is same like the one we currently have. Also They work well. I only used one keeping second one as spare for the future. I didn't want difficult design with all the other buttons I like this simple one that we are used to. I highly recommend it. Easy to use with 2 AA batteries.",
            "I‚Äôve repurchased these frequently because our household has a talent for misplacing remotes.\nThese remotes work interchangeably with all 3 of our Vizio TVs. They‚Äôre durable and hold up. Very similar to the original remote that comes with most Vizio TVs.",
            "Pretty good controller. Second row of buttons (Vudu, Netflix, and Amazon) never get used and cause problems ‚Äúdigging out‚Äù when they are inadvertently pushed. Better if they just had a blank row.\n\nAn easily accessible mute button would be a nice feature.",
            "Looks exactly like the remote that came with the TV, and my dog chewed up. Took it out of the packaging and had it connected to my Samsung TV in 30 sec. Works perfectly! (Free one day shipping as well) :)",
            "I bought this remote as a replacement for my old VIZIO Smart TV remote (XRT136), and it has been great so far. It worked right out of the box‚Äîno programming required. The buttons are responsive, and the layout is identical to the original, which made the transition seamless.\n\nIt also includes the shortcut buttons for popular streaming apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime, which I use all the time. The build quality feels solid, and it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap or flimsy at all. For the price, this is a fantastic replacement and saved me from having to buy a whole new universal remote or deal with pairing issues.\n\nHighly recommended if you need a quick, no-fuss replacement!",
            "Bought this for a 2017 LG Smart TV. Worked straight out of the box--almost identical to the original remote that we lost. No programming was necessary--all features on the remote are functional. I am not sure you can get a better, more economical replacement remote for an LG than this.",
            "Good. Works straight out of the box for 90% of functions on the Frame.\nThe only issues are the On/ Off does not have continuous hold and only puts the TV into art mode and not off/ standby.\nAlso the fast fwd button also isn't continuous and needs to press for any forward or backwards and not a smooth scroll like the original.\nNot bad for the price I guess",

            "I WFH so I have lots of things to plug in at my desk. I‚Äôve struggled with other power strips because charges tend to be bulky and cover the outlets around them. The design of this one is great, and allows a lot of different sized chargers to be plugged in!\n\nI like that it has an easy master turn off/turn on switch, and that there are USB plugs built in so I don‚Äôt have to worry about finding a connector.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt make any noise, and haven‚Äôt had any issues with low power even with multiple things plugged in.",
            "I have a CD duplicator on a shelf just inches off the floor. In order to turn it on I have to reach about a foot behind it to get to the switch. This to say the least is very inconvenient and I have to get down on the floor to do so. I installed this power strip to enable me to turn on the unit with a switch much closer to the front of the cabinet. it worked out really well. I can now turn on the unit without getting down on the floor. The unit is nice and compact and has outlets on the top as well as the sides. The side outlets were very convenient for me.",

            "It is mountable. Outlet capacity is great. I tested each outlet on this device. All of them work. I used it for my cell phone, laptop and my husband's phone at the same time. I did not notice any noise. But this is not in constant use in my home. I purchased it for our travel. Cord length is perfect. The cord is thick and sturdy. I like the plug design. It is raised just enough that you can grab and unplug it from the wall. The ones that have the plug completely flushed to the wall are very difficult to grab and unplug. I really like the lighted on/off switch. It allows me to see at a glance if it is on or off. The spacing between each outlet is perfect for large plugs. The plastic on this does not seem sturdy at all. Only time will tell if it holds up.",
            "I really like this power strip. It‚Äôs a flat plug and works behind furniture well. There‚Äôs 6 outlets and 2 on each side and 3 USB ports on the top. You aren‚Äôt able to mount this unless you use a command strip or Velcro. The power strip is small and not in my way at all. The power strip does take some force on the first plug in to the outlet but it works well. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was how warm the power strip got when using the usb ports. It was able to charge my phone at a 35 watt charge but it got warm and unsafe to have plugged in.",
            "I have to say that I am so happy that I found this power strip. The house I live in has single plugs everywhere. We've changed a few but there are a lot more to go. I couldn't tackle the ones in the bedrooms so getting this was the best thing ever. It has quite a few outlets so I can plug all my electronics into the strip and breathe a sigh of relief. The strip is made of durable plastic, was a breeze to plug in and works great! No more plugging my phone in the living room to charge. Oh, did I say it has USB outlets too? Game changer!!",

            "Someone at Amazon deserves many kudos for getting this Fire HD 10 13th generation (2023 release) tablet to me before I left for Guatemala in the early morning hours of Thursday, February 8th. A few days before my trip, I went to download content on my Fire HD10 9th generation (2019 release) tablet but it would not start. I disassembled it and found the battery fully charged but the power distribution chip was toast! Finding no way to get it repaired locally, I ordered another one February 6th which, before I added it to my cart and before I completed my purchase, was promised overnight shipping. The new tablet was to arrive Wednesday, February 7th by 11am. After completing my purchase I noticed this had been changed to just sometime on February 7th. I looked at my orders around 3:30 pm February 7th and discovered arrival was now February 9th! I called customer service, gave them the what for, was transferred to Amazon shipping, gave them the what for also, even offered to drive down to the distribution center and pick it up myself! I was left with little hope of getting my new tablet before my trip. Then at 9 pm, a knock at my door, someone had come through!\n\nThe Fire HD 10 13th generation (2023 release) has a vastly different x:y dimension than the 9th generation (2019 release). I had to order a new case but I like the new form factor better.\n\nThe Fire HD 10 13th (2023 release) collects a lot more dirt in the groove between its glass front and plastic backing than did either my HD 10 9th generation (2019 release) or my HDX 7 before it. I'm constantly trying to get it out with my thumbnails!\n\nThe power button is in the wrong place on the 13th generation (2023 release). 9 times out of 10 when I go to turn up the volume, I end up turning it off!\n\n\"Do what you love, uninterrupted\"...but only if you can find the secret to recharging faster than 5 to 9 hours! The Fire HD 10 13th generation says it's native Amazon 9W charger, depending on starting battery level, takes ~5 hours to fully recharge. That's way too long to wait if you're wanting to use your tablet! Read on and I'll tell you how to access 15W USB-C charging that only takes ~2 hours!\n\nI read Fire tablets with USB-C charging ports are capable of up to 15W charging. I did not want to buy a 15W charger (fire hazard) from one of the many 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offering them here on Amazon. I have other charges from a prominent brand here on Amazon, some claiming PD 3.0, offering up to 5V4.8A, and rated up to 60W, that were taking anywhere from 5 to 9 hours. Why didn't these work? What's the secret to 15W Charging?\n\nWell, I found it! Fire tablets with USB-C charging ports, at least the 13th generation (2023 release) HD 10, use the PD PPS protocol to negotiate 15W charging. But why didn't my existing name brand chargers provide 15W? There's more detail on that below.\n\nYou need a charger with PD 3.0 PPS or PD 3.1 (that's guaranteed to have PPS) to get 15W charging. If a manufacturer claims PD 3.0 but fails to mention PPS in the product description, use the \"Looking for specific info?\" box to \"Search in reviews, Q&A...\" for \"PPS\". You need at least 3A in whatever PD PPS voltage output range contains 5V.\n\nDetails:\nThe Fire HD 10 uses an order of precedence when negotiating a charging solution with a charger, first attempting PD negotiation then ultimately dropping back to basic USB Type C charging when PD negotiation fails. Basic USB Type C charging power drops off dramatically during charging leading to 5 to 9 hour charging times whereas PD PPS power stays fairly close to 15W the entire time. 15W PD PPS charging should really only take ~2 hours from ~10% to full or you've been taken!\n\nSome 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies are offering 5V3A 15W USB-A chargers using a USB-A to USB-C cable with integrated 56 ohm resistor to emulate a USB-C to USB-C cable. Sorry, these may be able to provide the requisite 15W but USB PD is just not available from a USB-A charger port. Some 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offer 5V3A 15W USB-C chargers using USB-C to USB-C cables that don't offer USB PD protocol. I have a handful of older chargers of these types from a reputable charger manufacturer and one does provide more power initially (11.5W) than the native 9W Amazon charger but basic USB Type C charging starts at lower power than true USB PD charging and drops off rapidly. I've seen the Fire HD 10 reported anywhere from 5 to 9 hours until fully charged for these basic USB Type C chargers.\n\nUSB Power Delivery (PD) 1.0 was released July, 2012. With the USB PD 1.0 you get six fixed power profiles for different device categories 5V2A, 12V1.5A, 12V3A, 12V5A, 20V,3A, and 20V5A.\n\nThe USB Power Delivery 2.0 fast charging standard was released August, 2014. With the USB PD 2.0, you got (fixed) voltages 5V3A, 9V3A, 12V3A, 15V3A, and 20V5A.\n\nThe USB Power Delivery 3.0 fast-charging standard was released November, 2015. USB PD 3.0 made functional improvements but did not present (voltage) differences compared to USB PD 2.0, you still got (fixed) voltages 5V3A, 9V3A, 12V3A, 15V3A, and 20V5A.\n\nThe USB Power Delivery 3.0 PPS fast-charging standard was released February, 2017. This version adds a programmable power supply (PPS) that can realize voltage and current regulation using USB PD protocol output. In addition to USB PD 2.0 and USB PD 3.0 fixed voltages, USB PD 3.0 PPS has specific PPS voltages, which are 3.3V-5.9V 3A, 3.3-11V 3A, 3.3-16V 3A, and 3.3-21V 3A, 3.3-21V 5A (100W Max).\n\nThe USB Power Delivery 3.1 fast-charging standard was released May, 2021. In addition to USB PD 2.0 and USB PD 3.0 fixed voltages and USB PD 3.0 PPS programmable voltages, USB PD 3.1 adds 15V-28V 5A, 15V-36V 5A, and 15V-48V 5A (240W Max).\n\nFrom a prominent charger manufacturer's website:\nPower IQ 1.0: Supports 5V/2.4A max\nPower IQ 2.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0\nPower IQ 3.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + PD 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0\nPower IQ 4.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + PD 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0 + Dynamic Power Distribution\n\nBecause of the way Power Delivery specifications were released, a manufacturer can legitimately claim PD 3.0 support without supporting PPS needed for 15W charging Amazon USB-C tablets.\n\nI have a 45W output charger from a reputable charger manufacture that my FNIRSI FNB58 says supports USB PD 3.0 PDO:4. The 4 PD output profiles are 5V ‚éì 2.4A / 9V ‚éì 3A / 15V ‚éì 3A / 20V ‚éì 2.25A. I see the Fire HD 10 briefly (about 1 second) hit 12.4W while attempting PD negotiation before dropping back to 9W basic USB Type C charging when PD negotiation fails. The Fire HD 10 reports 5 hours until fully charged.\n\nI have another 60W output charger from a reputable charger manufacture that my FNIRSI FNB58 says supports USB PD 2.0 PDO:4. The 4 PD output profiles are 5V ‚éì 3A / 9V ‚éì 3A / 15V ‚éì 3A / 20V ‚éì 3A. My FNIRSI FNB58 says the Fire HD 10 negotiates PD 1.0 14W but it seems unable to decode the device categories used by PD 1.0. It makes no sense but the Fire HD 10 reported 2 hours until fully charged for this apparently non-PPS charger. BUT, this weird PD 1.0 negotiation doesn't always succeed and, when it doesn't, the Fire HD 10 drops back to 7W basic USB Type C charging reporting 7 hours to fully charge!\n\nI'm including pictures of the Fire HD 10 charging at 14.6W \"43% ‚Ä¢ 1h:31 min until full\" on a car charger (sorry, it was dark), the car charger supports PD3.0 36.00W PDO:4 where PDO:4 is 3.30-11.00V 3:00A, the PD3.0 45.00W PDO:4 charger that fails PD negotiation and drops back to 9W basic USB Type C charging, and the PD3.0 60W PDO:4 charger that sometimes negotiates PD 1.0 14W and other times drops back to 7W basic USB Type C charging.",

There are numerous apps that focus on reading, and problem-solving, which keeps my child engaged while learning. The parental controls are also a great addition, allowing me to set screen time limits and monitor usage.\n\nBattery life is impressive; it lasts all day with regular use, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about constant charging. Overall, I would highly recommend the Amazon fire 10 Kids Tablet to any parent looking for a fun and educational device for their child.\"\n\n10/10 Recommend",
            "Recently my Fire HD 10 (9th generation) was acting up to the point I could no longer rely on it. This was odd as the HD 7 I got years ago still works, though its broken screen means I don‚Äôt use it.\n\nAfter reading the reviews I decided to go with a new HD 10 - 13th generation rather than the HD 11 which seemed expensive.\n\nNote, my Kindle Fire 10 does *not* have ads - I paid to have them deleted.\n\nThe 13th Generation Fire is night and day when compared to the 9th. It is fast, works seamlessly, and is in almost every way an excellent ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù product. My only caveat is the power button being next to the volume which, as another customer mentioned, is too easy to mix up and annoying. I would also put the 3.5mm stereo jack back where it was on the 9th generation: further up the side and out of the way.\n\nOtherwise, this is a fantastic improvement - really fast, no hiccups, and a really nice Kindle Fire. I just hope it lasts longer than the old 9th generation Kindle.",
            "This is my second Fire HD10 (7th Gen & 13 Gen) so, yea, it works for me. I mostly use it for Google News, Google Mail, and general web surfing. Occasionally, I'll do word processing or spreadsheets. It has all the processing power and memory I could need in a tablet. The display is fantastic and sound is decent. Printing on my home network was easy - it will ask you to agree to the Mopria (android print utility) terms of service.\n\nThis should really be a 5-Star ***** review. The problem for me is the Fire does not come with Google Play Services/Store. Google Play can be side-loaded (just search for it). I live in the Google/Android world. I want Google Search, Google Mail, Google Docs, apps from the Google Play Store, etc. Most important, I use the Google Chrome browser across phones, PC and tablets. Chrome syncs everything for me. I do not need another browser. I don't want another, restricted, environment like IOS or Fire. Thankfully they still allow side-loading Google services.\n\nThis time I paid the ransom for ad-free login. Glad I did. It may have only taken a fraction of a second to load the ad, but it was annoying. (I understand you can pay this ad-free upgrade fee anytime on older Fire tablets.) This 13th Gen Fire is a screamer. Get it when it's on sale.",
            "This 13th Gen A is a bit lighter weight than my 11th Gen. with apparent same durable glass surface. My 3d Fire 10. Suits my entertaiment needs for home and anywhere i have to wait around. Handles an IoT capable router. I bought a new Fintie case a few months ago for just this tablet and got a nice trade-in offer, so do have that in mind if you have a possible trade. I'm shipping my trade-in back to Amazon next week, so we'll see what they do give me for it, but i certainly got good use of my 2 previous Fie 10s."

            "This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.\n\nI'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.\n\nAfter doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.\n\nWhen I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)\n\nFor the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.\n\nI also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.\n\nAnd speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.\n\nAs a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.\n\nThe pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source. There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.\n\nI can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.",
            "Might be important to give context to this opinion: I am an audio engineer. I've used many kind of headphones within large ranges of budgets. I know what good sound is.\n\nAs the title says, I don't think you can get something that beats these at the same price. These punch way above their weight.\n\nTheir sound is punchy and have great balance across the spectrum. No harshness in the high frequencies, a mid range with great separation that doesn't sound cluttered and instead is very clean, and very decent low end (bass) that compliments the rest of the spectrum.\n\nSome people are getting used to overpowering bass of some products and while I understand the appeal of actually feeling the rumble in your ears, I will take deep, clean, balanced bass over that any day of the week.\n\nThe battery is phenomenal. I use these everyday and probably charge them every 4 days or so. The led of charged status can be misleading, so I just leave them plugged to the wall for 3-4 hours. Enough to get 3-4 days of usage.\n\nThe app is useful. Has some cool features.\n\nOverall, a purchase that after 3 months of use, I would definitely recommend.\n\nGreat job by JBL. They have earned good reputation for a good reason.",
            "So I will start by saying I am no audiophike, so keep that in mind when you read my thoughts on this.\n\nMy previous earbuds were the Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless earbuds. I used those pretty much almost daily for 4 years, which means I became accustomed to that sound profile. In the end the right earbud gave out and it was time for a replacement, which landed me here (after watching 2-3 hours of YouTube reviews).\n\nThese things are equipped with way more pros than cons.\n1. The JBL Vibes connect to my phones Bluetooth much faster (I have a Google Pixel 8 Pro)\n2. They fit my ears better, whereas my old ones would fall out of my ears while I was chewing or leaning over. If I forced them in deeper the sound disappeared. It was a not so fun game of \"stay put\".\n3. The app for the JBL Vibes is easier to use and actually connects to your earbuds without a lot of jumping through hoops.\n4. The case is more compact so it's not so bulky in your pocket.\n\nSo I'll start by saying my 4 star rating is a conflicted one. For the price these things are a solid 5/5, but as an overall I would give these more of a 4.3 out 5.\n\nWhen you first pair them and start using them you might immediately know why the app exists, it's to take advantage of the equalizer. To my ears they sounded tin-y and scratchy with the highs and mids coming in way too hard ( S sounds were so sharp it made music sound harsh and not enjoyable).\nSo I opened up the Equalizer and put on some music from YouTube, selected the Jazz sound profile as my starting point then tweaked to what sounded good to me (see my attached screenshot). The other issue is, I can't blast these at full volume, they get uncomfortably loud, and the sound starts to distort, so I keep them just short of full blast and they sound great that way. There is a setting in the app to reduce the volume at max, but it's lower than I want it to be so I do not use that. The big key thing to do is get good clean bass out of the sound profile so you aren't listening to ear piercing highs.\n\nSo now that I got the sound out of the way and like what I'm hearing, my next issue is that these are not the most comfortable. Don't get me wrong, they aren't so uncomfortable that I would return them, but there is slight discomfort at the top of my ear canal, where the hard plastic pushes against my cartilage.\n\nThe battery life is pretty good and they charge quickly inside their case, which stays shut pretty well (I did a drop test onto carpeted floor and it stayed shut). My other one gripe at the moment is that putting the earbuds into the case in the dark is kind of tricky (say you are listening to music or a video while your SO is sleeping next to you, and now you want to go to sleep too, but it's dark). I find myself rotating the buds trying to position that lower piece back into the case at just the right angle.\n\nWould I recommend these to a friend just looking for a good reasonably priced option for earbuds? Yes, absolutely....would an audiophile agree with me, who knows.",

            "I use this product with an iPhone 15 Pro Max and Apple Music. I am of the opinion Apple is better for sound quality but I will leave it at that. These headphones were purchased to replace my beloved Sony Bluetooth headphones which died after eight years. I couldn‚Äôt justify the price of another pair of Sony headphones so I purchased these over Amazon day for $50. To me JBL is a cheaper version of Bose or something higher end. They do have decent sound quality but it depends how they are used. For example they come with three different ear sizes in the rubber fittings they come with. I use the smallest ones. I use these mostly at home. I‚Äôve tried them on a walk and totally prefer my cheap wired Apple headphones so one, I don‚Äôt lose them and two the little stems that connect to the power klack against my wooden spacers I wear in my ear. The Apple ones don‚Äôt which is funny. And the JBl do not totally block out sound like my Sony ones did. I usually wear one headphone in my right ear so I can hear my kids and pets at home but still listen to my tunes. I have hearing damage from playing in a band in both my ears but my right ear can take the JBl‚Äôs comfort wise. The bass response or rich tone is based on how the rubber fitting sits in your ear. So if you move around a lot for exercise or work not good for you. They come with an app you can download for free. You can tweak the sound with an EQ. The ten band is fine if you have an ear for mixing. Pick some good music you like and usually listen to. Then play with the EQ to find a sound you like. The pre-sets are ok but not that good. If the headphone is in mono like I use them they will then cut the EQ in the app that runs on yr phone and go to your Apple settings. I just use ‚ÄúRock‚Äù on my iPhone. And they sound great for what they are. I wouldn‚Äôt use these while driving a car. Or use them for talking on the phone jobs. I have seen many ppl complain they are hard to take out of the case. No more then other brands/types like these. Each bud fits either in the left or right side so you know which is which. The L and R indicators on the stems of the buds is very small. Maybe some other brands or types are different. We have Skull Candy and Google Pixel buds in the house and they are similar and different too so shop around before you buy. And the battery in these are decent. I listen to several hours of music a day sometimes. I do recommend taking them out and giving your hearing a break for ear fatigue. Believe me, if I‚Äôve been listening to my headphones for awhile I‚Äôll be able to tell while driving later as the radio will have to be turned down and that‚Äôs no fun when a good song comes on the radio is it! Great headphones for $50 and exactly what I wanted to buy.",

            "Me encantan mis auriculares con cable. Aunque me encantan mis AirPods para escuchar m√∫sica mientras trabajo, no me sirven cuando necesito hacer una llamada. Estos tienen una gran claridad al hablar por tel√©fono, son c√≥modos incluso en mis orejas inusualmente peque√±as y la conectividad es genial. Este es mi segundo par; el primero se desgast√≥ hasta el cable, e incluso as√≠ me duraron varios meses a pesar de que el cable estaba expuesto. No puedo hablar de la cancelaci√≥n de ruido, pero siempre que me cambio a estos despu√©s de que la gente diga que no me escucha con mis AirPods, estoy encantado. Duran mucho tiempo con cuidado; creo que mi primer par dur√≥ unos 3 a√±os con un uso semanal. Si no quieres se√±ales de wifi en la cabeza y necesitas mejor claridad en las llamadas, definitivamente consigue auriculares con cable.",
            "I still love a good pair of wired headphones and these are some of my favorites. I fell in love with these after they came with my iPhone 5C, very happy I can still buy a new pair, these are more difficult to misplace than earbuds and the remote control is a lifesaver.",
            "My second purchase of these wired earbuds. I use them for my Android phones, the first with my LG V60, so got the ones with the 3.5 headphone plug, and which has awesome audio quality, and I got the same earbuds with its type C plug for my new awesome Motorola Edge Plus 2023. My opinion only, but I've tried numerous other earbuds and to me these have by far the best audio quality of any buds I've tried/used even including much more expensive buds. Great balaced bass, midrange and high end response (but not \"tinny\" sounding at the top). These have formed buds so they may not fit all ears but for me they fit great and have excellent full sound quality. Highly recommend you try them but make sure to order the ones with the 3.5 plug, or the type C plug, depending on your phone.",
            "Its annoying that iPhones no longer come with a set of headphones, so when I upgraded to an iPhone 16 Pro Max and the port changed to a USB-C my old headphones no longer worked. I prefer wired headphones (call me old school) for work so that my co-workers know when I'm on a call (I have long hair that covers my ears). I also use to run into issues with my airpods disconnecting and I no longer have that issue with wired headphones.",

            "Yes, my subject line sounds like that trash hyperbole you get on annoying pop-up ads on your Smartphone! And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.\n\nNow, first off, I am just a customer‚Ä¶ never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to ‚Äúclick on a review‚Äù for a discount or whatever. No‚Ä¶ the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I‚Äôm really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what ‚Äúguts‚Äù that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex‚Ä¶ nor expensive. How company‚Äôs like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!\n\nI‚Äôve tried those ‚ÄúRolls Royce‚Äù buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.\n\nTheir Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman‚Äôs voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.\nI‚Äôve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.\n\nAnd a note on their service. I‚Äôve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company‚Äôs for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it‚Äôs nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.\n\nNow, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY‚Ä¶ yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham ‚Äúlifetime warranties‚Äù, that corrupt company‚Äôs like Hammacher Schlemmer have.\n\nI had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry‚Äôs support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good ‚Äòol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.\n\nA day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience. The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.\n\nSo, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on‚Ä¶ and they love them. And none of had any problems.\n\nI‚Äôm sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I‚Äôve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!\n\nYes, goodness and quality still exist. It‚Äôs rare‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs out there!",
            "Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was \"Hallelujah.\" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.\n\nI have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even ¬Ω star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).\n\nEDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):\n\nNone of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).\n\nUPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).",
            "These are really great, especially for the price. I‚Äôm not one to spend a lot on something like this as I‚Äôm always afraid that I will lose them somehow. I bought these almost a year ago, and they are still going strong. I use them every single day and I‚Äôm always shocked at how infrequently I have to charge them. I typically walk around the house with just one earbud in, doing laundry, cooking, etc., while listening to music or a favorite podcast. I would say that on average, I use them from 2 to 4 hours every day. I should also point out that on two occasions, one of the earbuds fell in water (once while washing dishes and again while skimming the pool) and even though I do not believe they were advertised as waterproof, I quickly dried the earbud off, and it worked immediately. Didn‚Äôt even have to put it in a bowl of rice! I purchased another set for my teenage niece and she absolutely loves hers as well. I would definitely buy these again!",

            "I‚Äôve been using Rokus since their 2nd generation that I bought in 2010. They‚Äôve had their issues here and there over the years, notably internal memory that caused buffering issues when loading streaming services. Other little idiosyncrasies like remote control issues and video quality didn‚Äôt stop me from buying successive units over the years; and, now, we have the latest Ultra. For me, Roku has finally ironed out all the wrinkles and added some new features that make this streaming device exceptional.\n\nNot all the features are new but, now, this version has a backlit remote that can also control your TV and, hey, no more batteries. It‚Äôs rechargeable via usb c and holds a charge for weeks despite daily use. Voice control is also now a feature that has matured and now very well. It saves lots of time ‚Äútyping‚Äù in menu screens. Well done!\n\nI‚Äôm no audiophile but I use this Ultra with a higher end Samsung QLED with a fully wireless (that‚Äôs right, bluetooth) connectivity to a Samsung Q Symphony 3.1.1 slim soundbar/sub and the whole system works, looks and sound spectacular in a 14x20 great room with volume ceiling.\n\nThe new Ultra also allows super easy connection to bluetooth headphones, the first Roku device other than their TVs and sound bars to have that capability. And this feature performs exceptionally well.\n\nAll in all all the features are here and all of them work fast and very well. If I had just one critique it would be the size of the unit. Put all of it in a stick instead of a full size Roku and this would be a 11 out of 10 but I can hardly deduct a star for that. As it is, I have it mounted behind my TV screen, so neither the Roku nor cables are visible.\n\nSo, in all. this latest Roku Ultra is an easy 5/5. Outstanding!",
            "Where it shines:\nIt is fast, responsive, and customizable in ways that my TV's native smart features were not. Roku really does have the market cornered where those factors are concerned.\n\nI don't have a ton to say about pros because, frankly, it works exactly like it should and is an improvement in every way over stock features, which I summed up above.\n\nWhere it lacks/potential warning for future buyers:\nI really struggled to get it to work with my soundbar correctly. I tried every possible configuration, even went through lengthy troubleshooting with AI/reddit/etc., but no matter what, some device would not sync with sound and required the soundbar to be rebooted. Whether that was the roku's fault, the tv's fault, or the soundbar's fault, I'm unsure, but it had something to do with where the ARC hdmi signal was coming from. Basically, in one configuration, every Netflix show required the soundbar to be rebooted every single episode. In another configuration, the soundbar wouldn't work for our Nintendo Switch. In another configuration, Netflix worked but Disney+ didn't. It was super weird and so obnoxious that we made the choice to remove the soundbar entirely. Now, the roku works perfectly well, but we're stuck on our tv's horrendous speakers.\n\nOne other thing that's a disappointment is that the wifi modem for the roku is actually stronger/faster than the ethernet jack. IDK why they didn't put the more standard 100/1000 port in, but I would have loved to do that rather than put more load on my home network's wifi.",
            "I think the latest Roku Ultra is worth the purchase. The interface moves much faster and smoother than the one we had from 2021.\nI do like the 4K support it works magnificently.\n\nOne criticism: The ethernet port being 10/100M is pretty weak for these times. If this is supposed to be a front-line product it really needs to be 2.5G. While Roku claims they can support 802.11ac, I believe they have some work to do to be ready for WiFi 6e and 7. I also think they are incorporating old multiplexing tech which is limiting their ability to process at higher speeds.\n\nAll that said, it's a great purchase for $80-$100. The remote finder is very handy. The backlit keys are also pretty nice to have as well. The voice controls are very complimentary. I also find using the Roku Android App to be really responsive. Again, this Roku is WAY smoother and responsive than its ancestors.\n\nMy critique of the interconnectivity should NOT take away from a decision to purchase. I have 2.5Gb Fiber Service and I haven't had any buffering even with the Roku being a choke point in the data stream.\n\nI have bought Rokus for years now and I don't want to see another brand come along take them out. I love the \"agnostic\" format and the ever-improving features for the user experience. Just please, Roku, attack the interconnectivity tech next.",
            "I have already recommended the Roku Ultra to a friend that has an older Roku smart TV. She could not use the smart features of her TV. Her TV just did not work well as a streaming device. Now that she has the Roku ultra, she can now enjoy streaming on her Roku TV. I find that the device woks well. It was easy to set up and the networking works well. I use it on a 5 GHZ wireless network. I get no buffering with a very sharp picture just like using it with a network cable. I love the backlit remote and not needing batteries. It,s convenient to charge the remote when the charge gets low. If you,re in need of a streaming device, you can't go wrong with this one. Oh, did I forget to mention it has a remote finder feature, just in case your remote slips between your couch cushions, the Ultra has you covered. I,m very pleased with the purchase and I would do it again if I wanted another one. Well, that's all I have for you today. Have a great one."

            "1JUN2025 - Just got this camera a few moments ago, and I‚Äôd have to say that this camera has some bulk to it! This camera protrudes about 1 1/2 inches, but this accounts for the additional battery it takes, which are 3 lithium batteries that are provided.\n\nBlink also seems to have improved the mount on the bottom, where it‚Äôs now a push motion to separate mount from the camera.\n\nYou receive some additional tools for mounting and wiring, which come in sealed bags.\n\nThe instructions provided are very easy to follow and get your camera online.\n\nIt‚Äôs a worthy upgrade from the previous Blink doorbell camera! Will see how performance goes as time goes on.\n\n13JUN2025 - I‚Äôve had the Blink subscription to test the Person Detection for this doorbell, and it has been AWESOME! The position of my front door does not allow me to position it differently, so it has to face to road. I‚Äôve received minimal, if not almost zero notifications of movement from cars, car lights animals, and other movement.\n\nComparing it to the previous version of the Blink doorbell, this is a significant improvement. I had to constantly adjust the sensitivity to minimize the amount of unwanted motion, while also trying to capture the motion that were important, and saving battery life.\n\nNow with this new version, I am more comfortable maxing out the sensitivity and the duration of the recording, thanks to the Person Detection feature. And, this camera is easy to remove from the mount! I don‚Äôt have to struggle with using the prying tool to push down the clip to remove the camera. This now just requires you to push the spring loaded clip that holds the camera, and it releases with ease.\n\nThe fact the back camera itself is protect from the elements with an actual cover for the battery, is a great feature too.\n\nOverall, still very pleased with this upgrade, and I think you will too!",
            "As an add-on to our existing Blink system, this newest Blink Video Doorbell delivers excellent performance. The head-to-toe HD view is a significant improvement, providing a much fuller picture of visitors and packages, and the two-year battery life is a major convenience, greatly reducing maintenance. Setup was simple and integrated seamlessly with our existing Sync Module and Blink app.\n\nHowever, be aware that this newer generation doorbell is a couple of millimeters larger than previous models, meaning it will not fit most older Blink accessories available on the market. Always confirm compatibility for any aftermarket mounts or covers.\n\nMy only other minor wish is for future versions to offer support for house power instead of solely relying on batteries. While the battery life is impressive, a wired option would be ideal for continuous peace of mind.\n\nOverall, it's a solid performing doorbell with great features for existing Blink users. Just double-check accessory compatibility and manage expectations regarding power sources.",
            "Newest model! Wrks great! Alot faster then the previous model. I live in a apartment & we installed it on door molding. I can see alot more with this model! Almost around corners. Lol! U can see the \"whole\" person. From stem to stern. No more trying to figure out what someone has on or what they look like. You can see everything! Motion detection is alot better! Battery life is excellent even though it takes more batteries then the previous model. No big deal! Quality is awesome! Notifications come quick & on time! Value for money spent is awesome. I did have a percentage off; but I would've got it requardless. Functionality is really worth it!",
            "I always hate slightly long reviews but this might save someone the trouble. Very disappointed with this update‚Äî I wanted to like it so bad. Firstly, there is too much of a delay to start recording an event if the subject is approaching for the left or right side of the doorbell even with the highest sensitivity enabled. I suppose since it prioritizes a head-to-toe view, this works best for someone whom only has a direct front line approach to their door. If you live in an apartment like me you‚Äôll need a faster sensor to begin recording when subjects approach from the side because your door is likely facing a hallway. The 2nd gen HD doorbell works great for that application. I was hoping to upgrade to this camera from my 2nd gen to be able to actually see the deliveries left at my door but I immediately saw that the camera constantly didn‚Äôt start recording until a person was 2 steps from being out of frame when walking by. So theoretically someone could approach from an angle and scope your door without event being detected, that‚Äôs a no for me. With my current 2nd gen as soon as someone even tries to peak at view of my door from the side, they are detected immediately even with half sensitivity enabled. Lastly I was hoping the HD 1440 by 1440 video resolution would be a far better quality then my HD 2nd gen but it‚Äôs not visible at all. It just records a more portrait view rather than a landscape. And the so called ‚Äúsmart notifications‚Äù alerts you get with subscription is totally unnecessary and not helpful unless you live where animals often cross your door. Just seems like a gimmicky AI feature to please investors thinking every business needs to be apart of the AI buzz somehow. Overall if this is your first doorbell camera and you have only a straight line approach to your door, this is a solid inexpensive option, but if you‚Äôre just looking to upgrade especially from the 2nd gen, it‚Äôs not worth it."

            "I took this Cruise Essentials,6 Ft Power Strip with 3 Outlets and 4 USB Ports(1 USB C), Non Surge Protector for Cruise Ship, Travel, Home Office, ETL Listed, White - with me on a weeklong cruise. There were 2 plugs in the whole cabin and we all have so many electronics that 2 plugs are not adequate. This power strip was allowed on my cruise (Princess), I believe because it does not surge protection. If using on a cruise, please make sure before purchasing that your cruise line allows a power strip. During the week we used this to charge a power bank, 2 phones, hair straightener, personal fan, headphones, etc. I liked that a USB-C was included too.",

I have since used it at home and it is a great price point, excellent functionality and supplies power as it should. The design is great in that it has normal plugs and also USB plugs.

Most don't offer USB or C outlets and cruise lines don't allow surge protectors so this product is PERFECT for plugging in multiple items using USB C or up to 3 regular plugs. The cord is nice and long too! Perfect for a cruise. When not a cruise, I use it in my living room to give me multiple plug-ins!",
